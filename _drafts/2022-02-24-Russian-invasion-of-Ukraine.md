I have already written on democracies at [https://mdsheraj123.blogspot.com/2020/11/how\-to\-regulate\-harmful\-effects\-of.html](https://mdsheraj123.blogspot.com/2020/11/how-to-regulate-harmful-effects-of.html)

I have also written on the morality of war [https://mdsheraj123.blogspot.com/2022/02/what\-is\-absolutely\-morally\-correct\-also.html](https://mdsheraj123.blogspot.com/2022/02/what-is-absolutely-morally-correct-also.html).

I have serious doubts about Russian democracy, if they can do state sponsored cheating in Olympics \(confirmed by IOC\) [Icarus](https://g.co/kgs/Hys1sk), their internal elections is nothing.

It does not matter if Ukraine is historically linked with Russia if they are independent now and want to live that way. All these nonsense reasons fall when we realize that we all came from Africa ultimately.

If Ukraine wants to join NATO and not the Warsaw pact, it's their choice. Maybe Russia should have better policies, economics or political system.

Basically not suck so much that nobody wants to join them.

Coming to security reasons, Russia being the biggest nuclear power should not be concerned about that. 

This security reason has been given by nations such as Pakistan to indulge in regressive acts such as dictatorship and state\-sponsored terrorism. 

Nobody wants to take over Russia and even if they want, by acting offensively for a possible defence later is becoming the villain you are scared of, and doing to another country what you are afraid of. In this case, only you were just afraid but for Ukraine, it is actually taken over.

Remove your concern for Russia's security and think from the Ukrainian perspective. Such an invasion is completely unprovoked and unjustified. You are afraid of something so you do that to someone else so it doesn't happen to you. Rubbish.

What Russia did was offence, not defence, because that is what offence looks like. You attack others to gain a strategic advantage. In the same way, the US taking over Russia would be a strategic advantage for the US as it faces a threat from Russia. Rest is subjective.

Firstly we should avoid any military action because it leads to loss of life and humans have evolved enough to understand that decisions taken by force are not the best ones. It is not morally correct.

But you do defend militarily when you're attacked militarily. This is because military action already happened and we need to deter any military action. We cannot incentivize the use of force.

The other justified use of force is when the existence of an entity depends on it imminently. It is only reasonable to expect the entity to do anything in its power to maintain its existence that can be balanced by the gain from the entity's existence.

But there was no militarily attack here against Russia, also no imminent threat to its existence. So, how do they justify it?

Well, Russia was attacked in its strategic interests, but you can not use military force here. Nobody was stopping Russia from defending its strategic interests or attacking other's strategic interests too, but certainly, it isn't capable to do that.

Parallels can be made between people. When some group grows in popularity and you are not popular enough, you don't beat the other guys to submit before you. You can however make your group more attractive or become more popular yourself so that they are strategically inclined to shift to you. This is the best way to promote humanity.

Russia also needs to realize that it is no longer a dog eat dog world and everyone wants peace. Even the cold war dynamics are no longer present. If it was really up to the world to go against Russia, Russia could not do anything anyways. Humans are far more intelligent than this.

This world cannot run without trust. If there was no trust, you would not be safe walking on the road or even in your house where a missile can hit you. There is a shared understanding based on which the world operates.

No person alone is above the collective intelligence of a country to decide how to negotiate with this shared understanding and this is why what is happening in Russia today never happens in a democracy, Putin may or may not pay the price for this but his country certainly will.

Humans are generally the same everywhere and in groups, if a proper democracy is present. In that case, the decisions by a country are mostly along the same lines of widely regarded best practices. However, where democracy is not present like in a dictatorship, we cannot say that the decision is the people's decision. It would just be the decision of a person or a group of people.

For example, I don't believe that the decisions of China are the decisions of the Chinese people, certainly shouldn't judge Chinese people by China's decisions, they are just humans like you and me and would make the same decisions as us in a democracy but have no power currently.

Same goes for Kim Jong\-un and North Koreans. See my poem on war [The Man He Killed](https://mdsheraj123.blogspot.com/2021/04/favourite-pieces-of-art.html).
# So what are the consequences?


Persecution in one's own country is somehow acceptable by the international community. Case in point is Kim Jong\-un, Xi, Stalin, and initially even Hitler.

However, Putin might see a similar fate as Hitler as he ventured internationally.

I am expecting the Ukrainians to resist, Russia might not be able to hold on to Ukraine for too long.
We might also see separatism and if Ukrainian nationalism is high, also terrorism and with external support, the assassination of Putin because clearly nobody in Russia wants to invade Ukraine except Putin.

I think most Russians realize that their time is gone and they should not take themselves too seriously, except Putin.

As for whether assassinating Putin will unite Russia against the NATO and US, I don't think so. 

Russia is just one country. Remember France, the UK, US all have nuclear weapons. Hopefully, with Putin gone, they will think rationally. 

# Best way

The best way is for the people of Ukraine to decide via voting. Using force by Russia for personal gains proves nothing.

From the point of common people, expansionism is pointless. If you like Ukraine so much go and live there, adding to your country does not improve the life of a common man in any way. It is common knowledge that smaller countries are better managed and generally more prosperous.

If two countries see mutual benefit in merging and want to do so peacefully via voting, no problem in that.


# Human spirit


After reading George Orwell's 1984 and the condition of political prisoners in authoritarian states, this is just a remarkable human spirit.


Update: After more experience, I see that this is complicated and sometimes things become unbearable. NATO is not a joke.
