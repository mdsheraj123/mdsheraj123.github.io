The reason for wars is the other party being arrogant and not willing to listen or make concessions. 

It is the small things that get unbearable. This is natural, power corrupts and gives us the feeling of invincibility. Then we do not give space, concessions, tolerance, or dignity to those without power. They keep begging for the other party to listen.

When the voice of the other is heard and given concessions, usually by the left, things are good. However, if the party in power thinks their demands are too stupid, complicated, inconsequential, unimportant, or undesirable to accommodate in the existing rules that seem perfect and simple to the majority, one party builds resentment.

This problem should be fixed by peaceful protests bringing to light the misery of the weak, destitute, and oppressed, but if instead of listening if that the party in power in their arrogance or moral superiority refuses to accommodate concessions, and brutally suppresses their voice and oppresses it further, things may look fixed for now, but if you do it again and again at some point the resentment would lead to minor changes in the oppressed life and slowly since they cannot even voice their dissatisfaction due to fear of further oppression, they will wait for their chance and the chance surely comes some day and then they take over. 

The suppression of dissatisfaction also can be, from the point of view of the oppressor, minor reasons such as being tired of listening to others problems and just shut up and don't you dare open your mouth and bother us or there will be consequences. I see no problems in your life.

When the parties are both powerful and arrogant, and refuse to accommodate, or feel that one party demands unreasonable concessions, war happens.

Talk and discussion is the way forward. We must make sure talks are not restricted in their scope and no decision is taken without the happiness of all so that nobody feels cheated and avoids talk in the future.
