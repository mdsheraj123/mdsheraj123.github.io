I have visited my hometown in Ayodhya District of Uttar Pradesh after the win of BJP, the bigoted Hindu Nationalistic party.

UP is amongst the most backward states in India with a huge population density and widespread poverty with a very low per capita income. There is next to no advanced industry with the majority of the people dependent on agriculture.

The state has even regressed further compared to other states under the BJP rule.

Politics in UP has left me baffled after talking to the local people.
People here are not stupid but misinformed and have no way of finding the truth \(like  https://www.factchecker.in/ and scientific research\) except from Whatsapp forwards.

The most interesting part is the insistence that there is no right decision, just a fight for decisions that favour your or my community. 
Add to that mistrust in other communities. Looks like a byproduct of rampant corruption, not only economic, but moral too.

BJP's win just proves that mass misinformation campaigns \(Like the infamous BJP IT Cell and paid media\) work in UP.

By the time people would realize what they were told is a lie, there will be several new lies already widespread.
Lack of independent popular media is a contributing factor.

Electoral bonds legalizing corruption should be banned so that all this is not funded to this massive extent.

However it is interesting to note that BJP is specifically a party with the vote bank of the upper castes which is Bania \(businessmen\), Thakur\(landowners\), and Brahmins\(priests\) with some support of the poorer communities present due to the direct money transfer schemes. The lack of a unified oppposion splitting votes between the congress, SP, BSP and AIMIM made matters worse.

The key factor is however the use of direct fund transfer to account and efficient transfer of foodgrains to families which has helped BJP immensely rather than it's Hindutva ideology and I hope the BJP leadership realizes it.

Also note that the efficient grassroots welfare policies has not been able to spur development and making people self\-sufficient which requires peace, trust and optimism.
This can be seen in abysmal growth during BJP rule compared to previous governments. It is important to note that the innovations like direct fund transfer can be done by even other parties given the progress in technology.

Farmers voted for BJP even when stray cattle demolish their fields due to beef ban just for the grain packets.

This is stupid and against self\-sufficiency. The cow lynching of minorities almost every day just makes things worse. Ultimately, the GDP growth will slow down, people becoming dependent on freebies and the people be the ultimate losers in the long run.
