I feel that the reason people in the culturally heavy alcohol societies are so quiet is that they are addicted to alcohol and mostly under a hangover. They cannot express themselves without alcohol. They are numbed due to the intoxication. This is the reason why they are cold, quiet, and withdrawn and don't speak much. They all are showing the side effects of alcohol addiction. The USA tried to ban alcohol in the prohibition era but it led to a lot of illegal activity to circulate it. A lifetime of regular alcohol makes one numb and unable to express oneself normally. Then alcohol is needed to behave normally. This explains hangouts with friends and beer to relax and talk normally, it is simply not possible for them without alcohol. Somehow this is taken as a symbol of being "civilized". I want to explore the effects of alcohol for a lifetime while being widespread in society.

I tried to ask AI.

"A lifetime of regular alcohol makes one numb and unable to express oneself normally. We then need alcohol to behave normally."

Are there scientific studies on this. Things like long term effects of alcohol?

Yes, there are scientific studies that discuss the long\-term effects of alcohol on behavior and mental health. Here are some key findings:

\- Alcohol is a depressant, which can disrupt the balance of neurotransmitters \(chemical messengers\) in your brain and affect your feelings, thoughts, and behavior.

\- In the long\-term, alcohol uses up and reduces the number of neurotransmitters in our brains, but we need a certain level to ward off anxiety and depression. This can make you want to drink more to relieve these difficult feelings â€“ which can start a cycle of dependence.

\- Chronic alcohol use is also associated with other cognitive and mental health issues, including problems with learning or memory as well as exacerbating or causing serious mental health issues like depression and anxiety.

\- Some long\-term effects of frequently drinking alcohol can include persistent changes in mood, including anxiety and irritability, insomnia and other sleep concerns, a weakened immune system, changes in libido and sexual function, changes in appetite and weight, and problems with memory and concentration.

\- The long\-term effects of chronic alcohol abuse can include disrupting how brain chemicals transport important signals between brain cells. The results of this disruption can consist of memory lapse, slurred speech, slow reflexes, impulsive behavior, and periods of blackout.

\- Anxiety disorders, excessive agitation and restlessness, panic attacks, emotional instability or rapid mood swings, insomnia and other sleep disturbances, depression, aggression, anger, or violent tendencies, lack of self\-control, or unpredictable thoughts and behaviors, impulsiveness are also reported as long\-term effects of alcohol.

These findings suggest that long\-term alcohol use can indeed lead to changes in behavior and mental health, and can potentially create a dependence where alcohol is needed to feel "normal". However, it's important to note that the effects can vary greatly among individuals, and not everyone who drinks alcohol will experience these effects. If you or someone you know is struggling with alcohol use, it's important to seek help from a healthcare professional. They can provide guidance and resources for dealing with alcohol dependence and its effects.

How true is this? From your statements it seems that an addict without alcohol would be very dull.

The statement you provided is a generalization and may not apply to everyone. However, it does touch on some truths about alcohol addiction.

Long\-term alcohol use can indeed lead to a state where a person feels they need alcohol to function or feel "normal". This is often a result of physical dependence, where the body has adapted to the presence of alcohol and experiences withdrawal symptoms when alcohol is not consumed. These symptoms can include anxiety, restlessness, and irritability, which might be interpreted as being "dull" or "numb".

However, it's important to note that not everyone who drinks alcohol will become dependent or experience these effects. The effects of alcohol can vary greatly among individuals, and are influenced by many factors including genetics, environment, and personal circumstances.

Moreover, recovery from alcohol addiction is absolutely possible, and many people are able to regain their ability to express themselves and function normally with the right support and treatment. It's crucial to seek help from healthcare professionals if you or someone you know is struggling with alcohol use.
