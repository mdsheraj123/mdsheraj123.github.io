DEI efforts are on the rise in corporations and that is a good thing.

But apart from diversity of outer appearances, why don't we have a diversity of thought also?

I am not advocating force or quotas, just making the diverse people comfortable. I do not only believe in hiring people with different backgrounds and experiences, but also make them free to express themselves.

We can make people of different faiths feel free to express themselves and give the freedom of expression \(which includes the freedom to be wrong\) as long as nobody is forced and the work is not hindered which is the main goal of any capitalistic institution.

I want to emphasize that there is real gain in making people free as it reduces a lot of stress and makes everyone feel welcome. Diversity of thought is important for creativity and innovation in the workplace. It can lead to better decision\-making and problem\-solving.

But I really wonder if it really is possible to have freedom of expression in the office. Will people start to get offended? This is a tough problem.

Usually laws handle bad use of the freedom of speech by separate laws like harassment, defamation, libel and the like.

Would we need such exceptions for the office? It would be really difficult to have a huge bureaucracy to maintain it which is why I think companies simply don't bother and outright prohibit freedom of expression to anything not work related. This is stressful.

But accommodating diversity of thought might not be far\-fetched. We do allow it currently in offices by not outright banning it but whenever anyone complains, the person using freedom of expression is punished via internal evaluation mechanisms. Usually what the person expresses is completely legal and guaranteed by his constitutional rights but still he is punished.

Can we really accommodate Diversity of Thought in the office? It might be possible some day if we take steps towards it, just like we made DEI possible.
