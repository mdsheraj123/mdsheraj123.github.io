I was reading a book 'The Simple Path to Wealth: Your road map to financial independence and a rich, free life' by J.L. Collins.

The key lesson to me was to diversify my investment because nothing is totally risk free. The way to do this was something I have seen in many other places, by investing in total stock market index funds \(avoid speculative trading\). 

The reasoning is that we own a part of the companies this way and they make the best use of our money. The weak companies and assets are valued by the market accordingly and their share of the portfolio regulated. It is kind of like making others do our work for us.

The key message is very simple, but why invest and why not keep cash?

I was thinking about the catastrophic events like The Great Depression of the 1930s or financial crises like 2008 or COVID and realized that the main issues are either Deflation or Inflation.

Deflation is bad for stock good for cash.

Inflation is bad for cash good for stock.

Since today's currency is not pegged to gold unlike during the deflation of The Great Depression, inflation is easy and the norm for governments. Hence we should keep stock today.

Not pegging currency to gold might be a conscious choice to incentivise stocks since cash on its own is useless.

The tradeoff is using wealth now rather than save for the future. 

The negative is that we might use up all our resources.

It's all politics which decide what we do, but diversification in free market commodities seems like a workable strategy because we get the best price at the moment and there is less chance of being fooled. We should also keep some cash just to be sure.
