You meet a guy at a bar and consider two cases of his answer when asked about his children\-

1\) I have two children. One of them is a girl.

1\) I have two children. One of them is a girl named Julie.

What is the chance he has two daughters?

This video does demonstrate that the first answer is 1/3 and the other 50% with numbers quite well.

I'm here for the intuitive understanding and luckily we have this quite an enlightening example by Meeharbi N of his understanding of the issue.

"I think I get it. It's about how u word it. For the first one, what it is the chance that the other sibling is a girl given that one is a girl. The equally likely options are: girl that is being talked about, boy. boy, girl being talked about. girl being talked about, another girl. and another girl, girl being talked about. so it's 50\-50."

Basically the equally likely options instead of \-

GB

BG
***<u>GG</u>***

In the Julie case are

G'B

BG'
**<u>*G'G*</u>**
**<u>*GG'*</u>**

Understanding this intuitively, saying I have atleast one daughter consideres and gives information about multiple daughters like I have atleast one daughter can refer to any of the two daughters in the GG case a total of 4 daughters considered but GG counted only as one, so 1/3. 

However if I say that I have a daughter named Julie, that gives no info at all about the other daughter. He's talking of one daughter only, not two simultaneously.

Saying that one of the girls is Julie is not irrelevant. It removes the consideration of two girls in one case, as in earlier. What actually does become irrelevant is that he has atleast one daughter \- Now he has one daughter, removed from the calculation.

Also, think of it this way, having two daughters doubles the probability of that person having a daughter named Julie. So chance he has two daughters is 2x/\(2x\+x\+x\) = 0.5.

It's basically the same as saying \-

Hey, I have two children. Meet Julie.

And you're free to make assumptions about the other child.

Similarly, saying one of which was born on a Tuesday gives information combined of one or two daughters and not just a single one as in either one can be born on a Tuesday. The case for "I have two children, at least one of them is a girl" remains the same analysis at 1/3.

It is when the information given can be attributed to more than one person in the calculation is when we get different values.
