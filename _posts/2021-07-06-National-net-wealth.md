GDP is not a good measure of a country's value or prosperity. You can increase GDP by simply increasing government spending in a malicious way like building and demolishing the same road. [The Problem with GDP.](https://youtu.be/8T3Y9A7Xo-s) Actually, if the GDP is only boosted in such a way it would be counter\-effective in the long run as the value of the currency in that place would drop leading to either

a\) If uses a global currency like dollar: Money would be funnelled out of the nation given trading in global markets \(where it's worth more\) making the amount of money in the country smaller.

b\) If uses its own currency: Value of the currency itself would drop compared to the global currency or dollar otherwise.

But this would work on the total wealth of a country and hence work in the long term reducing National net wealth as we see later but reducing GDP only a little for the year.

However there's an alternative that most of us have not been exposed to. Here's the link [National net wealth.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_total_wealth)

However, reports such as [credit\-suisse global\-wealth\-databook\-2021](https://www.credit-suisse.com/media/assets/corporate/docs/about-us/research/publications/global-wealth-databook-2021.pdf) does not really measure National net wealth as the total worth of the country. What it really measures is global household wealth which does not give the true picture of a nation's worth as not every resource of a country is owned by the households plus it ignores the value of human resources.

I propose a different definition of National net wealth as the amount of money you would get if you sold the country instantly at the current market rate with the side effects of the selling itself ignored.

We have seen that GDP really does not measure how well a country is doing. It measures the total value of goods and services produced in a country but does not measure if only this year was bad in a wealthy country or it was financed by external debt and the way it measures it is by measuring how much money was spend and not the value that came from it \(1 million dollars could be spent on a road but its value could be 0 since it is in a very bad condition\). 

The best way to measure how well a country is doing would be to use my definition of National net wealth and see its change every year.

It has to be formulated well and maintained for each country. We would not exclude anything that can have a value like the worth of human resources currently present. It would contain all land worth, infrastructure, natural resources \(including biodiversity\) and human resources.

The calculation for categories not having a current value like human resources would be based on what the generated wealth over its existence will be. We would not consider humans producing babies as that has not happened yet.

It will be very interesting to see how well governments do on such an index. It needs to be made by an unbiased, uninfluenced third party for sure.

It solves the problem of malicious investments to boost GDP as such investments would not really increase a nation's worth.

One problem I can see in the implementation is the constant improvement in the mechanism for the measure of National net wealth. This problem is present in GDP too, however, in the case of National net wealth, the difference can be drastic enough to make it meaningless. 

There are problems such as how to deal with the discovery of natural resources which were always there? The solution could be to add this value to the past years as well. Just discovering a resource does not increase the wealth of a nation.

This raises an interesting question, what about the discovery of oil fields that have value now but let's assume won't have value later on? We add the value to the natural resource to the years as per its value that time.

Nations would have to decide if they want to be wealthy in resources or to utilize them to invest. The right tradeoffs would be the ones that maximize National net wealth.
**Edit:** I realized one thing after some time more on this topic. The National net wealth does not measure our quality of life, Gross Domestic Product does. You can be frugal and improve your Net National Wealth but your quality of life will be very low. Or you can spend all you earn \(improving GDP\) and not improve Net National Wealth but improve your quality of life.

I came to this realization after considering many western citizens who like a life of zero net wealth by taking on too many loans but their quality of life is very good.

I think an even better metric is required.
