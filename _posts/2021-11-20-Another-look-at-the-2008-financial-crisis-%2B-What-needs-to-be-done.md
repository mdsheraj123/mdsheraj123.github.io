Firstly, where did the 2008 money go?

Well, it went to the physical houses made prior to 2008, only they became worthless in 2008\!

It’s like spending millions to dig up gold only to find one day for it to be trash. Increasing wealth for a particular time in the future means increasing the goods that would be valuable\-‘THEN’.

If I want to increase my wealth all alone at an island, I would hunt for fish rather than dig for gold. Of course when I get rescued the gold would not be that worthless\! 

What should the government have done? Instead of giving free cash to banks, it should have started buying the houses. The houses are not worth trash \(prices have gone up again btw\).

This applies for anything that could be worthy in the future if given a chance, basically flattening out the fictious worth of goods in the economy curve. Basically a mermaid trading fish with the stranded guy for gold.

Conclusion: Anything’s worth depends on when we assess it. It could be utterly worthless or the most valuable thing on Earth.

The bubble was burst because people wrongly expected the houses to be worth in the future as much as they are now. Like sunglasses going out of fashion.

Imagine people suddenly discovering abundant platinum. Those involved in mining and selling silver will definitely go broke. Can we save them? Ask if silver would be actually worth what it was again? If yes, then I would as a good government \(cum businessman actually\) take advantage of the situation and bail them out by buying their silver

BTW if you’re so afraid of failing, don’t let anyone take risks \(very dangerous\).

An actual solution for the 2008 case; to smoothen out the defaults, would be to make people pay for their homes based on what it’s worth now.

Here's an analysis of that [Google Sheets](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-ieLz0_wkCkSHA2OE5kbWdUR3c/view?usp=sharing).
**LETS GET TECHNICAL NOW\!**

P = Price of the house ‘at that time’

Aleft = Amount left to pay ‘assuming no further change in Price’

N = Number of people who can afford homes

P should be greater than Aleft

For a sudden change ΔN \(in the time before the next installment\), so that this condition is not violated

\-\(dP/dN\)\*ΔN<P\- Aleft

Logic: P\- Aleft is the buffer that we can tolerate and \-\(dP/dN\)\*ΔN is the reduction in P. Aleft is the same just before the next installment.

Let P\- Aleft=x\*P

Here x is the fraction of the current price paid.

Then,

\-dP/P<x\*dN/ΔN

Implies,

x>ln\(Pold/Pnew\)

Let φ=1\-x

Here φ is the fraction of the current price left to pay.

Then,

φ<1\-ln\(Pold/Pnew\) = φc

This shows how paying now based on the past price affects the stability.

In my model, the price on which you pay is the current price, so Pold is replaced by Pnew and φc=1

So basically, even with no collateral, I can safely buy\! \(Don’t try this\-the house value in fact depreciates and also reduces with number of owners\)

But what about the current model?

I hypothesise that there would be a direct relation between the number of available homes \(N0\) and N. So if number of available homes \(N0\)increases by 20% due to defaults, number which can afford \(N\) goes up 20% \(as cost reduces by some other complex function \(demand matches supply\)\).

So, assuming we get a number of defaulters corresponding to a particular φc

Then the Number of houses in the market would increase lowering the prices. In the next term, we will start off with a lower price and hence lower φc \(most home owners are pre\-existing home owners\) this would go on tillwe cascade into a devastating default causing a financial crisis.

Usually, this does does not happen as homes usually appreciate in value and φc>1 and most people do not take more riskier loans.
