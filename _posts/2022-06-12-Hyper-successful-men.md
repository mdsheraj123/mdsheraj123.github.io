Jordan Peterson has covered this topic really well.

Men are generally less agreeable than women and given the gaussian distribution, that leads to almost all the least agreeable people being men.

The majority of the prison population being dominated by men can be attributed to this.

Also, this leads to the hyper\-successful men, those who are singularly devoted to one goal at the expense of everything else. The competition at the top is brutal and such men with their immense dedication generally occupy them.

We all see the success, power, and money but the struggle behind it is usually hidden.

Do you want to know how it is to be at the top? Watch this video about one of the legends in his field \(basketball\).



From his teammate.



CR7 is the same \(football\). I have even witnessed this personally too having a coffee discussion with the Samsung R&D Institute, Noida MD who was a Korean. Where he told about how he worked all the time at the expense of everything else and now regrets that he never saw his children grow up. But he became the MD, nobody else.
