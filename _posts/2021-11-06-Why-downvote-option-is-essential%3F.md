    Why downvote option is essential?

One thing good about places like YouTube and Reddit compared to Facebook, Instagram, Linkedin and Twitter is the ability to downvote posts. This prevents controversial views from rising which would get likes from one side and equal dislikes from the other side. 

Facebook says it is not giving the option to downvote to prevent negativity and bullying but the main reason is clear, which is to keep users hooked no matter the content they post.

Let's learn from examples of Linkedin. Its engagement model is not much different from Facebook and does not have downvotes. It is the only social media I use due to work reasons. 

As for my usage, I feel that professionally, I am open to many more people compared to being friends so I accept most of the connection requests. I also believe that the more connections, the more help I can get.

Still, my 1st connections are mostly people from my college, job or field. Everything is default and my experience should be a good indicator of the general experience.

I have given many chances to Linkedin posts expecting some quality but what I find is mostly cringe.

The user has omitted several options like Game Development/ Android/ iOS and users are forced to click the other options to know the results making the whole data flawed. This could have been prevented by just putting a "None of the above" option which is a hallmark of all legitimate, scientific polls.

I, like many people, would have downvoted this post but cannot and its reach and engagement only increases.

Now, consider this post

Firstly, the "poll" in this post overlaps with the core functionality of the reaction system making it meaningless. It gives a false sense of engagement to the algorithm. Also, people would simply click the like button more which is easier. This is used to promote the option that you want to promote.

Posts like these rise simply due to some gullible people. We are just wasting the time of so many people and feeding them with flawed opinions.

And then there are the senseless motivational posts that aim at a specific breed of people. Sadly they too get the targeted upvotes with no way to downvote and I have to see them.

If all of this is not bad enough, I saw a suicide note as a post on Linkedin by a foreign MS student. It has a lot of engagement. It was hurting the long term prospects of the student. Some might say the engagement was to highlight the post so action might be taken but this is not the way. I am sure it would not have been promoted this much by a system with the downvote option.

We have to trust our collective intelligence. Those pioneers and visionaries who go against the trend will do so nevertheless based on their conviction of the truth.

I strongly believe that adding a downvote option is the best way to redeem a site like Facebook. They might have more audience now, but as we see, their appeal is going down long\-term and it's not sustainable.

Either it will die a slow death or we would have several bubble burst in major scandals like ["The Facebook Papers"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0hy2QTqNuU).

Currently, I can post very vile and derogatory communal posts or comments on Facebook and it will actually have some likes with no way to downvote by sensible people and that is ridiculous.

Currently, sites like Reddit are not perfect even with downvoting due to subreddits with flawed moderation that act as echo chambers for certain ideologies. Still, it would have been much worse without downvoting and the users know what they are getting into with no illusions of generality.

Avoid social media without downvoting or else face controversial content or worse.
**July 2023 edit:**

It has been around 2 years and my thoughts have changed. There is a place for all sorts of social media.

I have seen some beautiful content on Instagram which would not have been possible with the downvote button. The dominant community would have simply killed the diverse content with downvotes leading to homogenous content.

This is the polarization and tyranny of the majority in action which is a problem of even democracies. It seems to me now that we cannot rely on the premise of good faith to drive social communities.

We should not create a hive mind with the downvote button.
