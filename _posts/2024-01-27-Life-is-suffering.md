Whenever I don't understand the world, I say to myself “Life is suffering” and suddenly everything becomes clear.

I would say this is not just an European idea, but this much more intrinsic to the nature of existence.

I have read all the Jordan Peterson's rules for life books and followed him for a long time to realize the meaning behind the quote "Life is suffering". It is not obvious, but I can guide you.

It is something like life is essentially suffering due to the nature of existence. Many think nature is so beautiful and we humans are the ones destroying it. They do not realize the ultimate harshness of nature. Those who think nature is so good should be left with nature in a forest. They would realize the harshness of nature when they see the hot sun, the cold winds, wild animals, nothing to drink or eat, no clothing, no shelter, rains, insects, they wouldn't survive for long.

We humans have made nature our way by having artificial shelter, agriculture, human societies for everything we need. Nature is harsh, even cruel. Now the nature of existence is suffering but we have made it tolerable by putting patches on the problem to hide it. However the cracks in our hiding begin to show all the time from earthquakes, cyclones, and other disasters to subtle ones like famine which if we trace the origins always lead to the fact that life is suffering, suffering is embedded as a part of the fabric of reality.

This thinking I agree is much older than anything even human, this is the reality of existence. The brain sometimes likes to think it is all powerful and the world is just its imagination. What easily brings the brain down to earth is the reality of suffering, which is certainly not imaginary, and nobody can escape it.

The founder of Buddhism, Buddha realized that life is full of suffering and the only way to remove suffering is to give up worldly pleasures.

Well, if life is suffering, then that gives rise to the idea of a place that is not suffering, heaven. We strive for heaven to make our life of suffering worthwhile.

Even in Islam, there is a saying 

"And the worldly life is not but amusement and diversion; but the home of the Hereafter is best for those who fear Allah, so will you not reason?"

\- Surat Al-An‘ām Verse No. 32 (English - Sahih International)

It is really tough to succeed in this world being straightforward honest.

It's a popular saying that we are like the waves of an ocean. Energy can neither be created nor be destroyed. So when the wave dies, it manifests as probably a leaf moving or a turtle's hand flapping. In the same way after we die, there has to be a place where we manifest. Maybe that's heaven, maybe it's true. Nobody knows.



Update:

If I am too distressed with the world, I ask myself if given ultimate power, what would I change about the structure of the world? 

The answer is nothing, nothing I could change can make it better. 

I won’t add more suffering and I won’t reduce suffering because a life without suffering would make us weak, this world is not the right place for it. Suffering also has to encompass the whole range of possibility, like the distribution of the velocity of atoms in a gas. Everything is perfect the way it is.

I would only make our life here better to have a better life in the grand journey of our souls. But by working myself, not by magic, otherwise the gains would not last.
