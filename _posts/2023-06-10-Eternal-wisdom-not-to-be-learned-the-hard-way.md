“The boss is always right.” 

\- Russian proverb

It is often used to describe the power dynamic between an employer and employee. The phrase is meant to convey that the boss has the final say in all matters and that employees should not question their authority.

“Don’t bite the hand that feeds you”

\- Sappho, Greek poet in 600 B.C.

\- An old popular hindi quote


Something to ponder upon. It is fine if we just don't speak ill of the authorities, we can speak ill of concepts, processes, or rootcauses reasonably but not target anyone personally. That is the way to bring change.

Like all things in life, there is no reward without risk.
