I have always emphasized that humans are essentially the same. We all have the same origin in Africa.

The genetic difference between two different human races is less than the genetic difference between two individuals of the same race. In fact there is no gene at all that is present in one race and not a different one.

However, there are conflicts and divisions between us as if we are not the same people essentially. We fight over religion, sub\-divisions in a  religion, race, skin color, physical characteristics like height, nationality, geography, caste, social status, and economic standing.

In countries such as India which has seen growing intolerance specifically targeting the minority Muslim population by the majority Hindu population, tolerance has become a difficult word to use openly. The previous 'Unity in Diversity' government has been particularly targeted and vilified for being tolerant and doing 'minority appeasement' by the current nationalistic Hindu majority party.

It seems the country is looking for a 'final solution'. But I would insist that a solution to diversity doesn't exist. Even if we remove all the religions in India except Hinduism magically, the division based on caste would still exist.

Even in countries with no religious or caste differences, they have bloody wars over intra\-religious divisions like Shia and Sunni. There are intra\-religious differences within Hinduism and Christianity also by the way. Even if not that, then people will fight over geography even within countries like in Sudan.

The conclusion is that the solution to the 'problem' of diversity is not becoming homogeneous robots but tolerance and consideration for all leading to peaceful coexistence and prosperity.
