I have already written about the problem with democracies <a href="https://mdsheraj123.github.io/2023/12/02/Democracy-and-the-propoganda-media-headache.html" target="_blank">https://mdsheraj123.github.io/2023/12/02/Democracy-and-the-propoganda-media-headache.html</a>.

Democracies, like communism are against human nature.

Lately democracies have become less democratic around the world. It seems like we have reached the end of the lifetime of the European idea of democracy.

So many countries today are democracies in name not in spirit. Democracy is a fairly new idea and by now people have figured out ways to break the system.

I want to say that we should stop holding on to democracies knowing that the whole idea is flawed. We need a better system as the fall of democracies are not a failure but only a matter of time.

Atleast in a dictatiorship there is no pretention of moral correctness, and I believe are hence much more fair compared to democracies that do the same but with moral approval. The best would be to live in a place with stable divine laws so that we can focus on our work.

وَيَمْكُرُونَ وَيَمْكُرُ ٱللَّهُ ۖ وَٱللَّهُ خَيْرُ ٱلْمَـٰكِرِينَ<br>
-Surah Al-Anfal<br>
But they plan, and Allah plans. And Allah is the best of planners
