Never really thought of it\! 

But trying rationally this time, here's what I conclude.

Firstly, let's define morality.
**morality**

noun

principles concerning the distinction between right and wrong or good and bad behaviour.

"the matter boiled down to simple morality: innocent prisoners ought to be freed"

\-a particular system of values and principles of conduct.

"a bourgeois morality"

\-the extent to which an action is right or wrong.

"the issue of the morality of the possession of nuclear weapons"

Winning a war only proves might is right and not necessarily that you were the morally correct side as per our current understanding of morality.

But then the mightiest humanity is the humanity that exists \(improving just military power is counterintuitive\) and also the most 'morally correct'. Because that's what we are, our morality is defined by what benefits humanity as a whole. Phrasing it again, what benefits humanity is ultimately what's morally correct for us.

Also, this means my morality may be different from your morality given our different circumstances. But then there must be the morality of humanity, that we can all follow and promote and what we are wired to value because of reproduction. If humans didn't value the morality \(my definition\) of humanity, they won't be a part of life today.

But our understanding of the morality of humanity is not that bad too, if we behave according to our current morally correct way, then other nations will support us in a war because of shared interest in the world order \(if they didn't they would be in threat too, everyone wants peace\) and the morally wrong nation while being militarily stronger than us will be defeated.

Acting like Germany of WW2 and focussing on purely military to dominate the world by force believing might is right would not work because it is not the morally correct thing to do. \(even if they win and only Germans survive in the world because they harmed themselves \(remaining humanity\) by losing their diversity\).

However, we should understand that with the development of nuclear weapons, wars are not the best way to resolve conflicts. This might is right concept should be extended to include moral might to make decisions. It is not good for humanity to waste resources to develop ways to kill each other, given we have barely progressed to space \(Type II\) [Kardashev scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale). We might end before we progress further if we are concerned with local events. We need better mechanisms to settle disputes \(not centralized but democratic and supporting diversity and freedom\) given wars are so pointless.

To understand this further, let's take a hypothetical situation of aliens coming to earth and wanting to divide the resources of the universe.

How will our representatives negotiate? I think the wise way will be of humanity first \(morality of humanity\) \(beware of counterintuitiveness\), nothing wrong in that, otherwise we didn't have good leaders.

Also, if aliens come and we thought of humanity first we might do many things that would be ethically wrong if Aliens were human \(If it ultimately benefits humanity\).

That is why eating plants and animals is right. Firstly, only plants are producers and can make their own food from raw materials, every other organism has to eat other living organisms.

Also, plants also hurt when we kill them, only they can't express it. Some scientists say that since they don't have a nervous system, they can't feel pain but surely we are hurting them just like we can hurt bacteria by slicing it \(it wants to preserve itself\).

Actually, our obsession for pain comes from the fact that we can experience it too and makes us feel closer to animals. But the distinction must be made that they are not humans.

We should think of our benefit first and certainly, an environment where human life is not sacred and murder and cannibalism is rampant will be harmful to us only. This is the reason why we must care for other human lives too as it raises the value of our life too.

Thinking along those lines an environment where we are cruel to animals also hurts us as animals are quite similar to us and that cruelty will transfer to cruelty towards fellow humans too. 

But we must not forget our ultimate goal of the morality of humanity. It's all a balance of power, take nothing for granted. Rules like morality aren't arbitrary, rather even such an ideal concept is derived from pragmatism.

The case of Aliens and our own well\-being dictates that our understanding of ethics needs to be improved a lot if following the ethically correct things does not always lead to the best possible output for us for the short, medium and long term.

Thinking even more, what should a small country with a weak military and formidable enemy nation do? This may be answered by a study of the morality of humanity but one thing is to be noted. 

You can be punished for not being perfect and it's **'fair'**.
