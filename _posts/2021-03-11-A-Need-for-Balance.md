The world can be sometimes easy, while sometimes can be incredibly tough to understand what's correct.

I have always wanted to simplify things and have guiding principles and as a Physicist that's really what we are all about.

In our quest to reason and remember everything we look for simple rules to decide every situation.

I believe that follows our personal lives too, sadly the guiding principles are not there and we need years of education just to decide on certain topics.

Even then the decisions are not exact in the sense that they help us choose the best course of action and not the 'correct' one.

Maths seems deterministic but even maths does not seem to be the answer. Look up [GÃ¶del's incompleteness theorems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorems). The theorems are widely, but not universally, interpreted as showing that Hilbert's program to find a complete and consistent set of axioms for all mathematics is impossible. Basically [Ali Sadegh Daghighi](https://www.researchgate.net/post/What_happens_if_mathematics_is_inconsistent%20%20) simplifies it as "it is possible that some day set theorists or other working mathematicians find an inconsistency between two mathematical theorems."
**So, what is the solution?**

I personally did not know about the problem of the consistency of maths and anyways wanted a Physics solution. In my mind, I always thought of Physics as superior to maths since Physics attempts to explain the universe and maths exists in the universe. Now I realize I might not have been too far from the truth.


I wanted to be Einstein and discover the next breakthrough in Physics given Physics has been mostly stagnant since the Standard Model. However, I wanted to answer the most basic question that underlies everything, the final question. Instead of trying to explain the how of everything like Physics does, I wanted to explain the why of everything. For example instead of how the universe started, why it did? What was there before the universe started and all such questions?


And that is why I came up with my [Theory of Everything](http://tinyurl.com/thetheoryofeverything) which is based on my Uncertainity Theorem.


That cleared up my head a lot and clarified a lot of questions and I could now imagine how things could turn up, even a God\!



I have been using this clarity ever since.


One of the things it suggests is that everything is random and things don't really matter and by extension that we should make the best of what we have and not worry. But need to be careful since going for the local minimas need not be the best solution which brings us back to square one, back to reality from our imaginary worlds.


This Theory of Everything might be helpful for really deep questions, questions about our existence, purpose, and religion for example, but today I want to share another principle that I have realized works way better for day\-to\-day practical life. And that is the principle of balance.
**The principle of balance**


This I have realized throughout my life, through a lot of trial and error, and still am refining. Earlier I thought being extreme in one direction is best, for example extremely studious. But too much of anything is bad, literally. There is also a principle of balance of having extreme and non\-extreme nature.


I think if we had a graph of extreme behavior of one person, ideally it would look something like this.

{% include image.html url="/assets/img/posts/extreme.png" caption="" alt="" %}

It would asymptotically go to extreme behavior for some topics\(never reaching it\) with a balance of extremes \(area under the graph\) of not always 0, but the area of the graph would have a graph similar to the same over time and different people.



The principle of balance is really important, it says that you should have a balance in everything in life and also that too much of anything is bad. You shouldn't be too conservative or too liberal but have a balance for example.

There is a debate between capitalism and communism but we all do understand that extreme manifestations of both are bad. We do need a balance to be most effective as there are some good aspects in both.



You can exercise but in balance.


What that exact balance is, can be known mostly practically but it's good to have balance in everything.


Remember that even drinking too much water will drain the important minerals from your body.
**Applying balance to politics?**

Another thing I have realized is that people sometimes criticize democracy for running by unopinionated stupid people mostly, but I realize it is a good thing.

Extremely opinionated people usually lead to the worst in humans. Let it be Hitler, Stalin, or Mao. Humans naturally have varying opinions with the mean usually having a balance. A huge population with balanced opinions is necessary to arrest bad ideas like a buffer for ideas that seem right in the moment. Simple people do not change their opinions easily which acts as a safety against being cheated \(the people most easily cheated are the midwits https://mdsheraj123.blogspot.com/2022/07/iq\-bell\-curve\-midwit.html\). Also, stupid people who find it hard to follow instructions make creating distopias difficult. If the ideas are really good, they will be accepted slowly but surely. A proper democracy respects that and that leads to good decisions. This shows that we should all not aim to be superstars, sometimes just doing your job well is very important in itself.


Since we all are all humans, and have the same origin in Africa, with almost no variation of DNA in aggregates, so not that different I realize that no 'country' is bad if you consider its people. Only its leadership can be bad if they do not respect its people's opinions, like the CCP. The only differences come from the environment and history. That is why it makes no sense to hate or love a country, it's the same as the love or hate of your own people too, or humanity.
**Aiming for balance in our lives**

People in India break their live savings and accumulated pension accounts to educate children in the US who disown them. We should realize that everything in this world is balanced and nothing should be taken to be granted. Things are stable and the way they are because there are consequences for any changes from the status quo.

Realizing this, we should not be naive and trust blindly, like with a business partner. We should be able to inflict cost for betrayal. This will ensure stability and expectations are honored and met.
