I just watched the 2020 Netflix documentory ["The Social Dilemma"](https://g.co/kgs/aKRxBs)

 
I know people are struggling to even define the problem and a possible solution seems to be seemingly tough to think of, but I have a solution \- 

Just 'ban personalised content'. That's it, it solves everything.

A common feed, same recommendations on Netflix for all, same results in Google for all. Companies like duckduckgo already do this. We must realize that we are all not that different in the bigger picture.

This means storing any data is meaningless and that there would be one source of truth.

Of course, it would hurt companies in the short term but brings long term benefits for all. Better than destroying everything in a social media bubble and jeopardising future progress in technologies such as AI.

Humans are dumb and intelligent and there is a range but the law of averages tells us that on average our intelligence is much, much, higher than any of us. This was proved in a research where the mass of a bull was asked and the closest guess would win a reward. The best guess there was the average of the crowd and not even experienced butchers guessed better.

It has also been proven that when two people work on a problem together, their collective IQ is more than any of them seperately. They seperately might not be able to solve a problem but together they can.

We should leverage our intelligence, something Wikipedia does by providing a uniform source of truth and social media companies, by personalising content are just destroying the opportunity and rather polarising us, preventing us from being more than the sum of each of us.

Democracies take good decisions usually. This is because if people are left to think on their own, usually the average decision is a very good decision. However if all people are exposed to each other in a non polarizing, uniform source of truth way, the collective decision would be even better than the average decision just like how two people working together can solve much higher IQ problems which are impossible for each seperately.

This is how Democracy moves from a tyranny of the majority to an inclusive one where we, in our huge IQ realize the need for a constitution, rights to all and protection for minorities even when it does not seem like it would benefit the majority directly/in the sort run, for the betterment of all of us collectively.

Democracy turns into a tyranny of the majority when we cannot use our collective intelligence due to polarization/ propoganda etc. This is what polarizing political parties need to win elections \- polarize and exploit the majority when you can never win by collective intelligence alone due to your ideologies.

One guiding principle to regulate social media could be to not have 

1\) recommendation, 2\) personalized and 3\) based on user data 

together. Any two would do. This will answer the question of how to differentiate between manipulation and companies just giving a better experience.

I have personally left almost all social media. I spend most of my time on Youtube however I haved turned off the user data part out of the three 

1\) recommendation, 2\) personalized and 3\) based on user data. 

Just go to your Google account settings and turn off Youtube history [Here](https://myactivity.google.com/activitycontrols?continue=https://myaccount.google.com/data-and-personalization&settings=youtube&pli=1)

It seems a lot like the old days but it's really good and the recommendations are also very good, no complaints there. Most importantly you can manage your feed via your subsciptions and not let YouTube do it for you. I would suggest you to turn off ads personalization too [Here](https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated?hl=en). It is possible that you need to turn off all data collection to get best results [Here](https://myaccount.google.com/).

One thing good about places like YouTube and Reddit compared to Facebook, Instagram and Twitter is the ability to downvote posts. This prevents controvertial views from rising which would get likes from one side and equal dislikes from the other side. Facebook says it is not giving the option to downvote to prevent negativity and bullying but the main reason is clear, which is to keep users hooked no matter the content they post.
