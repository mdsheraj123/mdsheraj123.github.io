I have a hobby of watching stand up comedy and watching non mainstream comedy from different regions and backgrounds helped me be exposed for the first time to completely new concepts that made everything make sense.

It is an amazing experience. People watching only mainstream content are missing out on a lot of things.

We are what we consume.

Watch non mainstream media only. We are already shoved too much of the mainstream whether we ask for it or not.

Listen to black women, Arab women, Japanese people and discover things you never knew. Truly humbling.

There is the search for truth that is supreme and most pleasant, everlasting, glorious, and beautiful without any second thoughts. Not the search for comfort that only brings short term hedonism.

Watching loads and loads of the same handpicked mainstream media will only make us memorize all of it and not make us truly enlightened.

The best person always seeks the truth.

It's called living in the real world and not a fantasy of ours or others.
