I participated in the last code jam Round A and it was fun\!

I cannot believe that I've solved all the Google code jam Round A problems completely with more than an hour to spare. I have certainly come a long way, and so have we all üòá

But this is not the same as before.

I did not use GPT, but no one can know and it's the reason for obsoletion of google code jam in my opinion.
Well a few days later I used BingGPT \(GPT4\) and it could not solve codeforces problems of 1600 rating which means it has not gotten that good, yet\!

The code jam had no future. Well defined coding problems can be solved by even current AI easily and the AI will only become more strong.

Google did not end code jam, OpenAI did.

The world will not be the same with the rise of AGI, our lives will dramatically change and the obsoletion of code jam is only the beginning. Exciting times üò∂‚Äçüå´Ô∏è
