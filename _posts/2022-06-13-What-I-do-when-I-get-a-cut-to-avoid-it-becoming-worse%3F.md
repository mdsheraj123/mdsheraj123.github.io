I guess most people know that 60% to 95% alcohol based sanitizers are effective in killing 99.99% of all germs [https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/share/T855NNTR2DHY28CYCHWK?target=10.1002/viw2.16](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/share/T855NNTR2DHY28CYCHWK?target=10.1002/viw2.16).

This is great news. How they work is here [https://youtu.be/245jz3ZqZqM](https://youtu.be/245jz3ZqZqM).

Now, what this post is really about. Appling alcohol\-based sanitizer to my wounds to heal it has been the most effective for me.

I've tried water, cleaning with soap, antiseptics, oil, and Soframycin. But the one thing that really stops the pain and heals my wounds quickest has been drenching the wound in alcohol\-based hand sanitizer.

Antiseptics may kill bacteria but Alcohol kills almost everything, completely sanitizing the would so the body can focus on healing rather than fighting germs.

Even if you go to a nurse's dressing room, they apply alcohol to your wound. But that alcohol is hard to find so the alternative for people has been concentrated vodka or whiskey or in my case hand sanitizer \(thanks COVID\-19\).

But there's a problem, it hurts like hell. Thankfully I have a high tolerance to pain so never bothered much and just bore the pain but I have something that might improve your spirits\!

Alcohol burning is not actually burning and is actually harmless\! [https://www.livescience.com/57932\-why\-do\-antiseptics\-sting\-on\-cuts.html](https://www.livescience.com/57932-why-do-antiseptics-sting-on-cuts.html).

Basically, Ethanol activates the vanilloid receptor\-1, known by the nickname VR1, according to a 2002 study in the journal Nature Neuroscience\(opens in new tab\). VRI is responsible for creating a burning sensation when it's exposed to heat or certain chemicals, such as capsaicin in hot peppers, Glajch said.

This means that the burning is just your receptors getting active at room temperature than when actually burning which goes away temporarily with no actual harm done.

Luckily, the burning sensation caused by both ethanol and hydrogen peroxide is fleeting. Moreover, it's not harmful, Glajch said.

"It's not destroying anything," he said. "It's basically causing this receptor to get turned on."

Another amazing thing is that if you apply the sanitizer at regular intervals, the burning sensation starts to go away which gives an indication that the wound is almost healed completely.

Basically antiseptics are also just this [https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/antiseptic\#summary](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/antiseptic#summary) but for some reason over the counter antiseptics like Dettol or Savlon have been less effective for me.

A little harmless pain is worth a lot more than a worsened pus wound which is intolerably gross and irritating for me \(which led me to explore all this\).

Also if the would is in a moist area like inside the mouth, scab formation can make things worse with infections. There I apply Amla oil to avoid scabs. The best way is to first disinfect with sanitizer and then put amla or Johnson's baby oil.
