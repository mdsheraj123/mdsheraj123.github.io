The son of a high court judge once told me when I was too agitated with politics, that only if everyone was concerned only with what affects them personally, then there would be much less fighting.

I was sceptical of this then, but it struck me as very insightful. I heard this first about 5 years back, and it was a passing phrase, but I revisit this quote almost every year. What if this was really true, following this certainly would make my life easier, but is it the right thing to do? What about the Kantian principle of extrapolating to if everyone in the world did this, would this work? The answer seems to be yes, but someone has to think of the bigger picture too, maybe those are the people who are spiritually concerned with this or in positions of responsibility specifically to think of this. 

There is also the question of if everyone does politics, and we don't, are we ok? The answer to this ultimately boils down to faith in the inherent goodness of humanity and the world. There is an amount of religious faith in "The world is inherently good, so if I do good, somehow magically \(via God?\) good will happen to me.". Paradoxically, in my personal experience whenever everyone does politics and we don't the benefits usually becomes far more for us rather than less.

The world has all sorts of people. As my father who rose to the highest rank despite all sorts of adversity also said in passing once, we have not taken the burden of all people. Anyways I believe with the burden comes some rewards, so if we are not getting anything in return, we aren't working for anything.

We should seriously ask more from our leaders if we are forced to do their work.

It seems that there is one thing that I have realized,

"No amount of me being good in politics can substitute for the lack of my competency in doing the niche job."
