Government jobs are not governed by free\-market rules. The role of the 'Invisible hand' in free markets is usually acknowledged but not present in government jobs.

They are run by taxpayer money, which is collected by force \(you will be put in jail if you refuse\). Even poor people pay a very high amount of informal tax \(like 18%\). Make tax optional and see how many pay.

In contrast, a private sector employee in for example Dell who sells laptops will get only as much money as the customer is willing to pay for his laptop. There is no force and if the customer does not want he might very well not buy any Dell laptops. \(How the money from the laptop selling is divided between the various job titles is also determined by how much value is added/how much money is earned\).

For something that is taken by force, it should have a very good reason to be collected and done at a minimum and used frugally, but this is not always the case as seen in lavish salaries for government employees disproportionate for the work they are doing and equivalent work in the private sector.

I do not agree that a janitor in the government \(for which PhDs also apply in India\) does some phenomenally good work that an equivalent private sector employee does not to be paid several times more.

There should be a match in demand and supply in jobs and not aim to hire overqualified people to do boring mundane work in government jobs resulting in a waste of human resources. Not to mention the billions of hours wasted in preparing for the 'IQ tests' of government jobs by millions of candidates. This wastes the youth of millions for a few thousand jobs, time that could have been used to be productive in the economy and building relevant skills and private sector careers furthering our economy.

It is common fact that most government employees even engineers are in administration and oversee the real development work mostly done by private contractors \(like TCS for websites\). Most government employees are not needed in the first place. They exist because there is no incentive for them to actually be productive in order to exist.

Even for profitable PSUs, the fact that they are government\-backed is a huge factor which means they are at an advantage compared to private players and will have better stock rating \(lower risk\), ability to take loans at lower interest rates and public trust compared to an equivalent private player.

This is bad because this is all taxpayer\-funded and that money to sustain these government establishments is taken by force. Does the public want to insure these organizations for free from their taxpayer money? The government employees of these organisations are reaping undue rewards from this money which is taken for granted.

Most government positions are cliques where they fill like\-minded people. The barrier to entry and bureaucracy is stifling.

On the other hand in the private sector, we make goods and services that people buy of their own will. I get as much money as I create value, not as per the government decisions based on whims in government jobs.

The only reason supply and demand are not matched even in menial jobs like ticket collectors is that they do not turn corrupt since they have so much power and minimal will of oversight as being productive is not a life or death matter for the administration.

Because of this chosen status and high barrier of entry for even menial tasks they have a superiority complex and think of themselves as rulers over the common men.

All the money paid to government employees eventually come from hardworking civilians. When the economy was not doing well in India before 1990 they were not paid so much but now when there is an economic boom in the private sector with more tax collection govt employees are paid more for the same work for no contribution of theirs.

I don't think this is just India specific. Pure socialism doesn't work. The most effective economic model is capitalism with government involvement limited to regulations.
