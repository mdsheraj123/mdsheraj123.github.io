[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent)*These claims must meet various patentability requirements, which in the US include novelty, usefulness, and non\-obviousness.*
In my experience the main contension point in patents is [Inventive step and non\-obviousness](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inventive_step_and_non-obviousness).

How Samsung evaluated my patents is to break down my patents in several steps and see if there is any step that is not present in the literature. I feel this is not a good way to know about patent worthiness as a novel combination of known steps has value and can be considered a patent if not obvious enough.

Let me explain. By the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics, entropy or randomness of an isolated system can only increase. Let's consider the patenting process. We want a reduction of randomness\(scattered knowledge\) to create order\(filed patent\).

Since total randomness can only increase, how do you achieve it? The answer is using existing order in other entities like existing knowledge and our minds. Total entropy will still increase in the process due to the increase in randomness in our minds. Our mind maintains its order by the energy \(non spontaneous reaction increases Gibbs free energy\) from the food we eat. When we eat food, we in turn use the order of the plants and the ultimate source of order is the Sun for us which is becoming more and more random and useless as time passes. Note that energy can only assist in the transfer of randomness, it cannot create order out of randomness.

This is the relation between Energy and Entropy *ΔG=ΔH−TΔS*.

Also eating food can give an order to our mind but not the particular order we need to make patents from existing knowledge. The best way food's energy is used is to maintain order.

Our brain is has accumulated particular order over the years and has been maintaining the particular order via food that we eat \(energy\). From childhood, our brain has become more and more ordered using the order it gets as raw knowledge and experience. This is a specific order for a specific purpose based on how it is trained. 

So the order required for creating a particular patent is present in existing knowledge and inside us based on our previous order \(knowledge and experience\). Experience is distinct from knowledge as it's not known by anyone else, it can be considered personalized knowledge though.

So we have inputs

1\) Scattered knowledge.

2\) The order in our brains.

The output is ordered patent.

Having an inventive step that cannot be derived from any prior knowledge is impossible \(Unless there are discoveries involved which we can include in experience. But discoveries are very rare and do all inventions need to be discoveries too?\) and hoping for the solution to magically appear before us. We cannot possibly recognize the solution without prior knowledge too unless by testing. Even if you gave me the cure for cancer, I wouldn't realize it. Sir Alexander Fleming had had the cure for bacterial infections in Penicillin but he couldn't realize it as it could not be deduced from prior knowledge. He only got to know when it was tested by accident in his petri dish. Not all discoveries are purely accidental, some are hinted by existing theories but not guaranteed like String Theory. If there is no prior knowledge of the cure for cancer then it is indeed a discovery and not an invention\(deduced from prior knowledge\).

So one discovery leads to several inventions for a long time. With how everything in the technical domain is already discovered, If you have a discovery you won't be much concerned about patents, rather expecting a Nobel prize \(E.g. Rainer Weiss, Barry C. Barish and Kip S. Thorne for the discovery of gravitational waves or Dan Shechtman for the discovery of quasicrystals\).

Every patent can be tracked to the order in some body of knowledge or experience. There isn't any patent that is not based on prior knowledge or experience. We are all here making order from chaos \(but certainly cannot do forever in case of a cold death of the universe\).
Our minds convert the raw knowledge into an orderly patent and that is our work. How efficiently we can create order depends on the particular order of our system \(our minds\). We should be rewarded for creating the particular order in our minds \(which can take decades\) that can make order from random knowledge.
We should be rewarded when there has been nobody till now with the required order in their minds to convert the prior knowledge into an orderly patent solution. To avoid excessive submissions the non\-obviousness criteria should apply.

The whole human civilization is order and would fall apart into chaos if not actively maintained.

Coming to the patent being non\-obvious to a person expert in the field. The person expert in the field has many a time got genius and inventive ability \(proof is several of his patents\) to see the gap in knowledge and make the leap in thought to invent the inventive step and it might seem obvious to him. Should we choose experts who have no inventive ability of their own? One extreme is a genius and the other is someone who has crammed all the material with no understanding. Do we give him all cherrypicked knowledge used in the patent, doing which is non\-trivial and doing most of the work for him?

The only correct approach is relative obviousness less than a threshold. There is no black and white in obviousness.
