A term which is part of BITS Pilani lingo and generally famous among Indian engineering students used for asking to not take too much stress about something the other person stresses about. Implies you can not do anything about it as a choice. This usually works in favor of the other person as he now has one less issue to deal with \(his own panic\).
A great way to cope with high\-stress situations and cheer someone up.

I remember a top doctor's advice on what to do if you cannot study too much, especially during exams when you are too stressed. He said to simply stop studying when you are tired and study when you are relaxed and feel like it.

This is really great advice, believe it or not\!

You can also sum up the values of the letters of "lite" with the alphabets mapped to 0\-25 for a surprise of what lite is :\)

Examples:

"I am so sorry I forgot your birthday."

"Lite dude\! Not a big deal."

A: I'm in depression and my therapist couldn't help.

BITSian: LITE lo.

A: Omg, I'm feeling much better now.
