A single income source for a region can sustain an economy 20-30x that amount. This is due to the economy multiplier of change of hands in money.

A single income source in a region can sustain a whole economy of support services like food, housing, shopping, utilities, transport, etc with their own companies. This happens for example when a city known for software exports become big.

This is why the income of a region of even small amounts in exports or tourism should not be underestimated.
