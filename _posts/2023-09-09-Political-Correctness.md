If I think about it, for the top jobs in either government, corporate, or any field, is it really required to be politically correct, job focussed, and creative? Plus to go above and beyond the task requirements?

Yes, such high pay is less than 0.1% of the world. This is exceptional with exceptional responsibility and expectations. There are people who don't do this and are more free but don't get such jobs and aren't so highly paid.

But certainly we should not be arrogant and think that the top people are superior. They have their downfall too. The best strategy is always to count on the whole of humanity to make decisions and to invest in the total stock market.
