Many US companies have headquarters in the US and offices all over the world like Europe, India, China etc.

We all know that having employees in the USA is much more expensive than in India attributed to the cost of living reasons. But why should the cost of living for employees be a concern for MNCs after a certain point? It should be the value they get from the money spent.

Certainly, if the companies paid the average amount of money they paid to US employees to Indian employees \(several crores of rupees per year\), they would certainly get the best talent of the country and I suspect much better qualified \(talent\-wise\) compared to the talent they get in the US.

So why do all these companies do all their core development in the USA, when it can be done in India in better quality if you pay the same?

I feel it is the nationalism of the leadership along with legacy, history, identity or political reasons. They are not completely altruistic in their pursuit of profit.

I know that Samsung has their headquarters in South Korea and they do almost all of their development there and mainly give debugging and support work to countries like India, China and Vietnam.

They also take the best talent from other countries like India and fly them to South Korea paying them huge salaries.

An Indian company would never have headquarters in South Korea for example, even a US company wouldn't for that matter, it doesn't make sense. Nobody does most of their development from South Korea too. This decision makes Samsung more of a South Korean company rather than an MNC.

What would be the alternative? Have your headquarters in your home country but have all the work like development in the country where it can be done most efficiently.

This trend has been changing recently though, but very slowly.
