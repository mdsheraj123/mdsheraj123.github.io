Background\->https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second\_law\_of\_thermodynamics

One of the interpretations is that you cannot extract heat from thin air without a heat sink. You know what\! I am gonna show you how\!

It's a magnet generating electricity when passing through a coil using Faraday's Law\! Getting work done out of thin air\!


Sorry for all that, actually I could have shown it just by putting my hand on the axle of the ratchet and pawl, and its back and forth movement would warm my hands. But I want to exploit the energy too\!\!\!

I know what you are thinking; Second law is so useful, how can we overthrow it?

Of course, your derivations are correct and the course from Duke University on "How to Reason and Argue" teaches me that for a valid argument to be unsound, given the conclusion to be true, it means that our assumptions must be wrong. I see that we have candidly assumed a homogeneous system every time\! Actually, on a molecular scale, there is a temperature difference between a region where there is a molecule and where there is a vacuum that can be used to do work. That too where we assumed there was no activity at all and was utterly useless\!

After thinking for a while I have seen that the best statement of the 2nd law would be "The entropy of an isolated system can only increase".

Of course, it's not easy to define entropy anyways\!

As for my contraption, it does conserve both the entropy and energy conservation laws.

Also, if we put a wall\(with wires passing through it\) separating two adiabatic containers, even then heat might seem to transfer from colder to the hotter body but that is not due to 'heat' transfer. And no doubt the entropy is increasing\!
