Eggs existed long even at the time of dinosaurs. It took millions of years after the earlier eggs for the chicken to exist. In short, the egg came first.

But then you might say the egg should be a chicken egg.

What do you mean by a chicken egg or a chicken? I would consider that to be genetically a chicken egg or genetically a chicken by composition.

Consider the first genetically chicken. It did not come out of the womb as it evolved from dinosaurs and dinosaurs laid eggs. So the egg the chicken hatched from was the first egg the birthed a chicken, or the first genetically chicken egg.

In short, the egg came first.

When we think about the chicken and egg problem, we need to consider what creates a new species. We now know it to be genetic mutations or a novel combination of genes from mother and father. This process happens when the egg is created and not when the egg is hatched. A non genetically chicken egg cannot give rise to a chicken magically.

But did the egg come first or the first living organism? We know the first living organisms were single\-celled organisms, so the egg was not the first living organism.
