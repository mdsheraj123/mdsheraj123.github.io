I have always been fascinated by economics and how money works. Today's fake money backed by nothing physical takes things to the extreme and most people give up trying to understand it.

It is strange how life in some developing countries would be considered by me to be superior compared to the developed countries but still the worth of the people \(in monetary terms\) would be 1/10th or 1/50th. Hedonism and lack of family does not make a good life but it seems to be able to make a life worth more.


I have studied Economics as a hobby for about 10 years now through University courses, YouTube videos, and writing my own analysis via research and math.

I have tried to track what exactly gives value to everything in terms of money.

It seems that the life of a postman in India is worth 1/50th the life of a postman in the USA when they eat the same food, save the same percentage, send their children to similar schools, spend the same percentage on Healthcare, and spend the same percentage on recreation.

So where does the 1/50th come from? It seems everything in the USA is perceived to be a little bit better, for example better infrastructure and spotless streets.

But to be honest, do I really care about these things? Is it really better in the USA? It is subjective. 

Clean streets do not really improve my life that much when the tradeoff is bad weather, everything expensive, hedonism leading to lack of family and a broken social support system due to individualism.

But it seems that some people prefer the USA and it seems their preference has more weight on who has value.

There are a lot of things like GDP, trade, stability, growth, and so on that matter but I want to emphasize what I have realized, it is ultimately politics which determines value.

You can produce as much goods as you want but if it is valued at 1/50th, there is not much you can do.

You can have the best company but not be able to scale globally if you are headquartered in a non developed country. People devalue simply based on politics.

I have tried to track what really gives value for the work of a common man doing regular jobs like carpenter or postman and I have come to the conclusion that in the final analysis, the valuation of money is ultimately determined by politics. The effect is really strong and often extremely understated. The world is not a fair playground.

Politics decides that the services of a postman in India is worth 1/50th that of someone in the USA for doing exactly the same job.

Politics decides that the company in India will not be able to scale globally but when the same company is headquartered in the USA it will suddenly be a Unicorn.

Things might be better a little bit in many aspects in India or the USA, but by how much, and if some way is better in the absolute number scale of money, is determined by politics.

Please note that I am talking about the absolute worth in terms of fake fiat money. It is not necessary to take it seriously although it does affect many countries tragically due to imperialism when they ignore it. You might be worth more in terms of fiat currency but if you get 100 and since everything is expensive, food costs 40, living 30, and you save 10, then that does not make your life 50x better compared to another person that does the same.



Please note that increasing valuation is not always better. Many developed countries have completely lost their manufacturing sector for unsophisticated goods due to too high value demanded of them because of the high valuation.
