<iframe></iframe>Never knew I would turn into a fan of RISC so fast\!In my favorite technique to distinguish between two options, let's take extremes\!RISC is like running machine code directly \(with the possibilty of optimization that comes with it\).CISC is like running C code directly. Which will be faster? I hypothesise that this is dependent on the data bus speed which is fast enough. Prior optimization wins. RISC wins\!
