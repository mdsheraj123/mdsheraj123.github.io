I can explain bootlicking at the wisdom end of the distribution.
More context on the wisdom end here <a href="https://mdsheraj123.github.io/2022/07/05/Midwit.html" target="_blank">https://mdsheraj123.github.io/2022/07/05/Midwit.html</a>

It’s the ancient wisdom “The boss is always right” and “disagree and commit”. 

If I am working for a company it makes sense for me to give my 100%, even if things are bad, I should be positive and work on fixing things, otherwise I should just quit. 

It’s called professionalism (doing a halfhearted job while accepting full payment is unprofessional in business). Also called being honest.
