The world pays those who make the world better. This is because to get paid, someone should pay you and that someone will only pay you if we are making his life better. It is a transaction and there is balance in the world, we get what we give.

So the only way to make money is to help people.
We can help people directly in the way they like via doctors, teachers, bureaucrats, engineers etc.

We can also help people in the way they don't like by exposing the flaws in the system to help make it more resilient and we get rewarded in return via scammers, criminals, murderers, kidnappers etc.

The society cannot afford to have many game the system and threaten the existence of the system itself rather than let it develop. The society however also needs people to make sure the flaws are found out and ironed out so the society develops with resilience.

How to punish some and reward others of the people gaming the system so that the society flourishes?

The answer is honesty. 

If the person finding out the flaws is honest about the intention then it is ok. For example ethical hackers find vulnerabilities in code however they are honest about what they are doing and following the laws, crackers however lie because they are breaking the law.

Hindenburg helped to find vulnerabilities in the Indian business environment which will hopefully make India more resilient however it is okay because it was completely honest in its intentions and did not break any rules.

This brings me to my belief that as long as we are honest, never lie, and follow the explicit rules \(for extra safety follow implicit rules knowing what we have signed up for which is not easy to determine\) we are mostly safe.

To find a better place to stay or work, look for places with better explicit rules \(mission statement, contract, etc\) but it would be wise to check the implicit rules too \(a startup might have the same explicit rules as established firms but due to poor following of rules and dishonest management tactics may have a lot of politics and implicit rules that we should be aware that we signed up for, given we have not joined an established firm\).
