There has been a focus lately on listening to the experts which many people have realized lately is wrong.

I have covered in my previous blog <a href="https://mdsheraj123.github.io/2023/10/11/History-is-written-by-the-victors.html" target="_blank">https://mdsheraj123.github.io/2023/10/11/History-is-written-by-the-victors.html</a> and <a href="https://mdsheraj123.github.io/2023/12/02/Democracy-and-the-propoganda-media-headache.html" target="_blank">https://mdsheraj123.github.io/2023/12/02/Democracy-and-the-propoganda-media-headache.html</a> that just re-reading a particular perspective does not make us wise. A totally uneducated person with his own original experiences and learning the hard way can be wise.

The focus on education is a sign of elitism which is unwarranted. It is just one of those mob mentalities. Education gives a person a false image of wisdom which I have often seen as just not true.

I totally understand the focus on removing power from the so called experts, many of them are just highly educated, and back to the truth and reality.

Many of the experts are wrong about so many things, and that too with false confidence. They are repeatedly proven wrong every time and never taken to accountability. Relying blindly on the experts is a sure way to fail miserably.

If anyone observes how these experts actually become experts one would realize that they never think of the big picture or have any idea of it. They just follow the existing conventions and work on a narrow segment their whole lives. Most of them study or work for the sake of it and enjoy their lives while talking of big things about which they have no complete understanding, personal experience, personal stake, or accountability. Years of experience does not make them wise about general stuff.

I personally know people highly educated in obviously the popular western ideas and convinced beyond question by just re-reading the same perspective that they left their perfect and superior lives back home for small jobs in European countries in delusion.

I want to clarify here quite clearly that Education != Competence. The best competence is by learning, with the best learning being learning the hard way.
Education is mostly remembering othersâ€™ ideas and it is most prevalent in the arts side.

Everyone should think the best for themselves.
