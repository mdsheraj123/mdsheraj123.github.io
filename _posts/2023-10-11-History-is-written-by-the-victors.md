History is written by the victors. The evidence and truth is removed. We only see what the victors allow us to see. This applies to media, books, research papers, and everything. I am still wondering the way to get to the truth. The only way might be to start from scratch. The victors might have won, but has humanity as a whole?
*“In war, truth is the first casualty.”*

― Aeschylus

History is written by the victors not only in the sense of might is right but with dishonesty and often barbarism.

I see this all around us, the ideology in power is obviously the best one and everything revolves around that. Even with the flaws, that's all people know. This only delays the fall, but when it does, it does so spectacularly.

The ruling ideology becomes so ingrained that to snap out of it is next to impossible. We remember all the arguments supporting it and they come in the way of the bigger truth. The drawbacks of the ruling ideology is something that is acceptable for us as we are used to it. Our minds simply cannot grasp the bigger picture fully. This is an information war.

This feels like being ants in a hive with limited worldview, a bigger entity can manipulate us by guiding our senses, sometimes the bigger entity is our own structures preventing us from seeing the bigger picture. 

The weakness that is exploited is the limitations of our own brains. We cannot imagine something we haven't seen or experienced, and all effort is persistently gone into ensuring that is the case. George Orwell comes to mind.

The pillars of modern civilization, concepts like Freedom of speech, all men are equal, equality before law, and others are imaginary and don't really exist. They are definitely not absolute, and have unlimited conditions. It is a matter of implementation, up to interpretation, and tied to the convenience of the authority in power. This is definitely not how they are advertised. Read the book "Sapiens".

At the end of the day, it's up to what the people in power allow and their constraints. It is just the bigger reality ignoring which is often catastrophic. People like Jordan Peterson claim the authorities are based on competence, based upon their own subservience to the mainstream, but when I see around me, there is next to no interest in preserving the truth, the truth is overrun.

But the truth has a ugly habit of revealing itself again and again. 
*"Truth shines bright. It has a nasty habit of coming out. So, no amount of banning, oppression and frightening people is going to stop the truth from coming out,"*

\- Rahul Gandhi

Reaching the truth is very difficult for a life we lived since birth but some people do reach the truth. They are the enlightened. Making the intelligent reach the truth is hard enough, making the simple people reach it is just too much. It can take more than a generation of propaganda to make an ideology mainstream.

As for me, I am skeptical of any strong opinions now, because I am limited as a human, I can never know the full picture. I cannot also consume loads of study material that is handpicked for me, written with a specific viewpoint. I don't know where to search for the truth, does it even exist anywhere? It is sad. 

I also now realize why people who claim to have followed the case very closely always miss the point. I guess they just go too deep into the details of loads of simple mainstream articles having other's point of view. We should do our own research, from scratch. It is tough but there is no other honest choice.

Amid all this uncertainty, I can't do this always, probably with no success, but there is only one thing I can do, and that is to have faith in God.
*“They plan, and God plans. Surely, God is the best of planners.”*

\- Surah Al\-Anfal | Ayah 30

No human’s IQ is high enough, compared to the cosmic IQ of God we are all stupid.
**Update:**

I talked with a few people and realized that Human Rights are not 0 and 1, there is a lot of variation in between. Some countries, although different, are just objectively better on unbiased objective fact based universal indexes, as opposed to opinion based. How the indexes are made can be debated and improved, but to really appreciate human rights, go to North Korea, or be a Palestinian in occupied Palestine. Human rights are a guiding light, a beacon of hope for the weak.

If the world is bad, then is the alternative that you are suggesting any better? I have read "Animal Farm" by George Orwell.
