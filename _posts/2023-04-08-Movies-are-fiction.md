I don't usually watch movies. Also TV series for which this article applies to too.

The movies I do watch are culturally significant with either record setting box office collections like 'Avatar' or historic movies like 'Laal Singh Chaddha'. This is a way of getting the best content from humanity and being culturally educated and aware. This is one of the reasons I watch a lot of the top movies throughout history even if they are in black and white like Citizen Kane.

However these are exceptions. The problem with movies in general is that even when based on true events \(not documentaries\), there is a lot of creative content which makes them strictly for entertainment.

The problem with creative content is that they are fiction. They are the writers' or directors' imagination brought to life and need not have any connection to reality. This makes it impossible to take the movies seriously and have positive life lessons from them.

The problem is made worse when we bring in the commercial aspect of movies. Movies do not show reality, rather they show what the audience wants to see. 

I used to be a regular watcher of movies, watching a movie in theater every other week, however I first realized this existence of fiction in movies when I saw the movie Super 30 [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super\_30\_\(film\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_30_%28film%29) which is based on the story of Super 30 institute in Bihar [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super\_30](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_30). Now the movie was entertaining but made me feel uneasy if the events actually happened which made me open the Wikipedia page only for me to realize the whole story was completely made up most likely from the founder himself who decided the plot. I felt cheated and dejected but it opened my eyes and I started to see the patterns, not only in Bollywood but also Hollywood. The same thing I saw in the first Robert Pattinson's Batman movie where they made the villain Riddler look like a young school shooter which is completely different from the comics most likely because it is more relatable to the target audience. I realized you have to be well aware of current trends and affairs and the zeitgeist of the audience of the movie to realize the choices made in the movie.

There must be a better alternative, right? Yes, there are documentaries which aim to showcase factual reality rather than making up fiction. Luckily a lot of documentaries are made today and with very high quality from the likes of Netflix, BBC, DW Documentary, and many others including YouTubers.

There are documentaries that showcase the struggles, hopes and aspirations of people and also their pain. Documentaries also show the real life of people which might not seem bigger than life but which I prefer as opposed to the fake thing.
However, documentaries can also be biased and may not always present a balanced view of events so it is important to use our discretion and focus only on the facts and not opinions.
The good thing about documentaries is that as a concept they show reality but there can be creative representation of it, however documentaries cannot show something which is objectively false.

Watching a movie might just waste our time but watching a documentary brings out a wiser person on the other side. Remember we get the same number of hours on Earth, however someone becomes an eternal legend for their caliber and wisdom while the other becomes a nobody barely making it by.

On the positive side of movies, they have played a great role in our culture and shaping the popular opinion. The reach of movies is unmatched. Every human on earth has watched movies and that too dozens of them. Movies are watched, preserved and rewatched for eternity. Even if the movies do not depict reality, successful movies show the hopes and aspirations and struggles the common man relates to at that time.
It is like comedy which uses fiction to showcase real concerns of people that they relate to.

Movies can also be a form of entertainment and can help people relax and escape from their daily lives. I am not sure if documentaries can replace that but good to know what we are signing up for when we spend our time.
