*A life worth living and what should be the most esteemed virtue.*
*Life as a great legend in our contemporary times.*
# Favourite Quotes
*“Opportunity is missed by most people because it is dressed in overalls and looks like work.”*

\- Thomas A. Edison.

\(Some of my worthwhile accomplishments have been quite easily achieved because almost nobody was willing to take the extra responsibility. I also believe there is no shortage of opportunity this way, the world can be made a lot better.\)
*“In the midst of every crisis, lies great opportunity.”*

\- Albert Einstein

\(If there were no crisis, we would have nothing to improve. If looking for opportunities, look for crisies.\)
*
"Surtur: You cannot stop Ragnarok. Why fight it? 

Thor: Because that's what heroes do."
*

\- From Thor: Ragnarok \(2017\)

\(Thor's line alone gives you goosebumps when you realize the depth of it. We all realize the significance of the hero's journey and how it relates to our own life's many journeys. Thor's quote is contemplative at least and inspiring at best.\)
*“To be wealthy and honored in an unjust society is a disgrace."*

\- Confucius

\(Very well suits the military who slaughtered civilians to break the defending countrie's spirit honored as war heroes in their invasion of a peaceful country.\)
*“A business absolutely devoted to service will have only one worry about profits. They will be embarrassingly large."*

\- Henry Ford

\(The customer is the biggest boss and the reason for the existance of the business. Companies like Amazon who are customer centric are inevitably successful, but if you look at jugaad startups which only aim to make money by any means possible including scamming customers don't last more than a few years. If takes something special in terms of core ethics for a company to last more than a century.\)
*“The purpose of thinking is to let the ideas die instead of us dying.”*

\- Alfred North Whitehead
*"Be careful what you wish for, lest it come true\!"*

\- Aesop’s Fables, the world’s best\-known collection of morality tales.  

What you wish for so badly when it becomes true might be the biggest curse. The radical right that's currently in power with an absolute majority in India wants a "Hindu Rashtra" rather than a 'India', but if it comes true, it might very well destroy the whole country and the promise it shows, turning it into another war\-torn and secluded Rwanda. Similarly, wishing for huge riches can be the biggest curse, as can be seen in how the winners of millions in a lottery have their way of life completely destroyed along with the breaking of their social support and close relations.

*"The most dangerous creation of any society is the man who has nothing to lose."*

\- James Baldwin
*"A child who is not loved by the village will burn it down to feel it's warmth."*

\- African proverb

People snap, sometimes it was the last straw that broke the camel's back.
*"I'm blessed everyday, I'm blessed every second of everyday"*

\- Homeless man recycling stuff.

Shows we can always have gratitude.
*"Saving one life is like saving the world entire."*

\- Talmud
*"Expression via speech, writing and otherwise allows our thinking to become refined via exchange of thoughts."*

\- Me \(Inspired by Jordan Bernt Peterson\)
*“Feminism does not want to make men and women equal. It wants to make women equal to men, and there is a difference. The difference is the focus area of problem\-solving given our limited focus and resources; it's in its name.”*

\- Me

It's just like propoganda, focussing on only the side which you favour's point of view and problems.

*"The Indian Caste system is regressive nepotism by higher castes to create a clique for their profession in society. It survived as it organized people closely via marriage along with their profession."*

\- Me
*“The reason for skin color racism in India is that typical Indian skin color can adapt based on exposure to the sun from fair to very dark. This is an easy way to perceive wealth and privilege via looks for those not needing to do manual work. Contrast this with African countries with all dark and European nations with all white populations. Even in the US with blacks and whites, skin color does not show privilege as the skin color cannot change.”*

\- Me

## Truth

To tell the truth is to bring the most habitable reality into Being.

Truth builds edifices that can stand a thousand years.

Truth feeds and clothes the poor, and makes nations wealthy and safe.

Truth reduces the terrible complexity of a man to the simplicity of his word, so that he can become a partner, rather than an enemy.

Truth makes the past truly past, and makes the best use of the future’s possibilities.

Truth is the ultimate, inexhaustible natural resource.

It’s the light in the darkness.

\- By Dr. Jordan Bernt Peterson \(Rule 8: Tell the Truth, 12 Rules for Life\)
## How to Not Be a Perfectionist

People are vivid

and small

and don’t live

very long—

\- By Molly Brodak
*Reminds me not to take things and people too seriously.*
## Wisdom

Life is suffering,

Love is the desire to see unnecessary suffering ameliorated,

Truth is the handmaiden of love,

Dialogue is a pathway to truth,

Humility is the recognition of personal insufficiency and the willingness to learn through dialog,

To learn is to die voluntarily and be born again, in great ways and in small,

Speech must remain untrammeled so that dialog can take place,

So that we can all humbly learn,

So that truth can serve love,

So that suffering can be ameliorated,

So that all of us can stumble forward to the Kingdom of God.

\- By Dr. Jordan Bernt Peterson
*One more quote I really like from Jodan Peterson's 'Beyond order' is "Abandon ideology". The world is too complicated at higher levels to have simplyfying assumptions like ideologies. We should embrace the complexity and deal with it.*
## What I Expected

What I expected, was

Thunder, fighting,

Long struggles with men

And climbing.

After continual straining

I should grow strong;

Then the rocks would shake

And I rest long.

What I had not foreseen

Was the gradual day

Weakening the will

Leaking the brightness away,

The lack of good to touch,

The fading of body and soul

Smoke before wind,

Corrupt, unsubstantial.

The wearing of Time,

And the watching of cripples pass

With limbs shaped like questions

In their odd twist,

The pulverous grief

Melting the bones with pity,

The sick falling from earth \-

These, I could not foresee.

Expecting always

Some brightness to hold in trust

Some final innocence

Exempt from dust,

That, hanging solid,

Would dangle through all

Like the created poem,

Or the faceted crystal.

\- By Stephen Spender
*A poem on growing old. [There will be a time when we are no longer potential](https://qr.ae/pGBbpy).*
## The Man He Killed

"Had he and I but met

            By some old ancient inn,

We should have sat us down to wet

            Right many a nipperkin\!

            "But ranged as infantry,

            And staring face to face,

I shot at him as he at me,

            And killed him in his place.

            "I shot him dead because —

            Because he was my foe,

Just so: my foe of course he was;

            That's clear enough; although

            "He thought he'd 'list, perhaps,

            Off\-hand like — just as I —

Was out of work — had sold his traps —

            No other reason why.

            "Yes; quaint and curious war is\!

            You shoot a fellow down

You'd treat if met where any bar is,

            Or help to half\-a\-crown."

\- By Thomas Hardy
*Anti war poem.*


“Of all tyrannies, a tyranny sincerely exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive. It would be better to live under robber barons than under omnipotent moral busybodies. The robber baron's cruelty may sometimes sleep, his cupidity may at some point be satiated; but those who torment us for our own good will torment us without end for they do so with the approval of their own conscience.”

— C.S. Lewis
