Here's some constructive criticism from an editor\-
*
Dear ,

Thank you for your submission “The Theory of Everything.” I regret to inform you that after careful consideration we are unable to accept your paper for Stance this year. In an effort to provide constructive feedback, below is a summary of the central comments our reviewers offered regarding your paper:

The paper is bold and expresses originality in its answer to whether there is a theory of everything. It attempts to tackle large questions and question commonly held and unquestioned beliefs, which is something we appreciate at Stance.

Although the paper does showcase originality, it has several problems in its argumentation, modesty, and the rigor applied to the topic. The paper does not consider possible opposing voices, but instead states that what they are claiming is not arguable. With the thesis not being recognized as contestable, the author does not really put forth much of an argument for the thesis. The paper also does not consider other sources’ views on the topic, but instead tries to argue the topic in isolation. There are many different works on the theory of everything, yet none of them are taken into account. This makes it so the reader is simply dropped into the discussion without any context as to what the author is really arguing. The paper would be improved by adding opposing views, both possible ones and ones that already exist, in addition to a more modest and academic tone.

If you will still be an undergraduate in December 2016, we welcome another submission for our next publication.

Thanks again,

Cameron McNeely

As of now, I am not spending any more time on this. But still I would love to take any comments.
## ABSTRACT

Ever heard people say that if there is no God then what is the true reason for everything? The current physics aim to find a unifying theory can find the required equations to explain everything but cannot say anything about how they came to be in the first place. The theory of everything is as the name suggests a theory which gives an explanation of all that could be there is an answer to these questions.

Although we have laws which “seem” never to be violated but at the same time have no reason not to. However good our efforts seem to be; though practical \(at least in our experiments\) our knowledge seems not to take us in one direction towards the ultimate truth, but in multiple directions.

When newton found mechanics the world thought we were close enough to the ultimate knowledge but were wrong when we looked at things from a different perspective\-big\-relativity and small\-quantum. And the big stuff is our solutions work specifically\-for us, for quantum or for relativity, they do not work together.

Our plug and chug had never and will never work and any comparison to practical reverse engineering is flawed simply because we don’t know what the end product looks like.

Now probably our failure with philosophy seems significant\-our analysis of the bigger picture has proved that we are indeed trapped. Here our practicality lacks direction and philosophy lacks practicality. And just like quantum and relativistic worlds we cannot mix them.

We do not know what we would do if encountered with another unknown baffling strange situation. We cannot ever understand it completely without a sense of the bigger picture and with another practical solution would mean again complicating the simplicity the world seems to have.

We cannot possibly seem to have any sort of idea on what the ultimate truth may look or feel like and possibly how it can lead to an understanding of everything with nothing left out and no contradictions.

So what is to be done? The practical or the broad minded? The answer lies in one aspect we have been missing all along\-uncertainty. And this must have long been inculcated from nature.
## INTRODUCTION

Ever heard people say that if there is no God then what is the true reason for everything? The current physics aim to find a unifying theory can find the required equations to explain everything but cannot say anything about how they came to be in the first place. The theory of everything is as the name suggests a theory which gives an explanation of all that could be there is an answer to these questions.

This work on this basically started in the July of 2013 as an attempt to explain the inconsistencies prevalent in physics. Slowly ideas from fields like philosophy and biology were used as the theories of physics seemed insufficient to answer our questions. The result was the theory of uncertainty, a theory which based on one simple principle that “Uncertainty Causes Everything” explains the logic of everything \(including our universe\).

The idea was perfectly consistent with all we knew and the logic was sound. But only after building on that work it could be realized that this could be a theory of everything. So, just how a ridiculously simple concept of uncertainty can help us explain all there is?

To tell you, that is a very tricky work. But by the way I see things, the most basic and an elementary foundation for further work on it has already been done. A major problem is that anything build on the uncertainty theorem will not be completely perfect in some sense. It can at best be a framework for the “understanding” of all phenomenon. I still do not know where our understanding of everything can lead us. Certainly the way we understand stuff plays a role here.

The work on the further development of the T.O.E. is still on\- there is a huge promise in even the most basic of its applications and as the name suggests\-IT CAN LEAD US ANYWHERE.
## THE SEARCH FOR THE ULTIMATE TRUTH AND UNCERTAINTY

It is natural to wonder and think on many aspects, viewpoints and opinions on the world that bother us and sometimes such relentless thinking can get frustratingly pointless given it has been pursued by almost everyone existed and from different angles and still is there absolutely nothing for certain that can be said about this world in general considering the bigger picture of existence.

Philosophy... can we consider it as a solution? The inability of philosophy to find any sort of practical advantage baffles me. Also every new life begins fresh except the immediate skills of survival and learns its way or educates itself. If what we learn till the very end essentially the same for all, is it in any way possible for the humans of the future to have trigonometry in their genes or is an intelligent yet unassuming person a far superior one.

Does our growing knowledge point to the slow unravelling of fundamental truths about the universe or is it just our assumptions for survival.
I have noticed that we are great at connecting stuff and forming fragile yet quick connections about everything and this often yields an often obvious but flawed sense of correctness.

It is possible that what we have discovered till now is untrue and in fact just a statistical complexity of the bigger picture but with more and more experience the chances of this happening is steadily diminishing\(and this seems to be the reason for our excitement every time everything seems to fit in\).

Although we have laws which “seem” never to be violated but at the same time have no reason not to. However good our efforts seem to be; though practical \(at least in our experiments\) our knowledge seems not to take us in one direction towards the ultimate truth, but in multiple directions.

When newton found mechanics the world thought we were close enough to the ultimate knowledge but were wrong when we looked at things from a different perspective\-big\-relativity and small\-quantum. And the big stuff is our solutions work specifically\-for us, for quantum or for relativity, they do not work together.

Now this is precisely what I am trying to explain\- our plug and chug had never and will never work and any comparison to practical reverse engineering is flawed simply because we don’t know what the end product looks like.

Now probably our failure with philosophy seems significant\-our analysis of the bigger picture has proved that we are indeed trapped. Here our practicality lacks direction and philosophy lacks practicality. And just like quantum and relativistic worlds we cannot mix them.

We do not know what we would do if encountered with another unknown baffling strange situation. We cannot ever understand it completely without a sense of the bigger picture and with another practical solution would mean again complicating the simplicity the world seems to have.

We cannot possibly seem to have any sort of idea on what the ultimate truth may look or feel like and possibly how it can lead to an understanding of everything with nothing left out and no contradictions. How would we know if we had found it? Are we ready to completely understand it? What if the lack of it is the ultimate truth, is it then worth pursuing. And finally do we really need or want it.

We all seem to agree that we are missing a very huge or vital “obvious” point or link but yet nobody could point it out. Just like in the case of the story of figuring out the elephant we are blindly examining narrow minded particular cases.

Here the attitude “we may be wrong but what choice do we have” or “is there any harm in trying” may be working. But the question is whether we can really discover something of which we know nothing.

Our research may be driven by practicality but our goals seem not to. The biggest discoveries were made by thinkers who were least bothered by their practicality. It is like someone launching a new product we never knew we desired.
Thus it seems like a practical approach is not the right one just because it seems to be the obvious one. But again... who cares about philosophy\!\!\!

Our worldview and our confidence based on it seems to be fundamentally flawed with a deep sense of security \(based solely on past experiences\) and it only seems that we are fooling ourselves.

So what is to be done? The practical or the broad minded? The answer lies in one aspect we have been missing all along\-uncertainty. And this must have long been inculcated from nature. Suppose a brand of super humans were developing in one part of the world and suddenly a tsunami wiped them off but a group of humans ordinary though survived. Was nature fair? Well stupid in our narrow mindedness but fair.

Although it may not be perfect, the presence of the ‘LUCK” factor makes it far superior to other models. There can nothing more limiting and ‘trapping’ than excessive anything and that uncertainty seems to be the best way to open new horizons. And it seems to be the only secret recipe for nature’s uniqueness.

Is the ultimate truth all around us or non\-existent or a big idea we all have been missing all along. Can it be just a matter of perception or wisdom and we simply do not want to accept it the way it is.

We may never find out but with the “uncertainty” factor seemingly inherent in nature’s plans anybody, anywhere and anytime can strike on it. 
## THE UNCERTAINTY THEOREM

It establishes uncertainty as a defining feature of the universe we exist in and even independent of it. \(It is not just a consequence of the uncertainty principle; in fact it establishes the uncertainty principle and all other such principles as its consequences\).

It states that the reason why nature is the way it is to be uncertainty and that every part of the universe be it physical or conceptual has an inherent uncertainty and that is also imbibed in the nature of the universe.

The realization of this lies in the fact that there are certain logical inconsistencies associated with the lack of it and without it the existence of the universe as we know it faces certain contradictions.

Without it the universe will either come to a halt \(lacked sense\) or prolong itself as a sort of repetitive computer program but with a question mark on the programmer and its intention, location and in turn it’s universe and so on till it becomes a contradiction in itself.

But this is not the case at all. The fact that the universe is the way it is points to certain special properties of uncertainties \(which bring some sort of certainty or at least an illusion of it\) not yet discovered.

Now it’s quite clear that we have been merely studying the manifestations of these unknown properties. But the fact that the properties may again not be certain, points to extremely deep complications and the facts like why exactly in the physical world ∆x∆p=h/2π would prove to be the greatest problem faced by mankind\(or not\!\).

That this is taking abstraction to the very next level is obvious and the only way to solve it would be to study it very closely and make out contradictions and consequences. So not just math but stuff like philosophy needs to be put in it.

We have to see how all sorts of our theories fare in the tests for uncertainty to see how deeply they are involved in the uncertainty scenario. \(Least postulates etc.\). However ultimately all theories will be its consequence. One such connection I found was\- Somehow there has to be no uncertainty in the existence of the principles itself, since the existence of the universe is assumed “I think therefore I am” is an excellent starting point. But hey, this is only a proposition\! Anyways an uncertainty in the existence of uncertainty is yet another uncertainty. It\-self justifies\!\! By the way that the universe has a starting or an end seems not to be a fundamental principle.

Needless to say, although daunting this seems to be a highly promising and exciting prospect. The main reason is that not only it is always valid, true and makes sense and has no parallel etc. etc. but that it is a defining aspect of nature in the sense that the universe cannot exist independent of it but "it" can. And that is the fact that theories based on unproven postulates seem baseless in front of it.

The fact that we can evolve a whole universe using just one “all encompassing” principle\- that of uncertainty is certainly working at the highest level.
## UNCERTAINTY CONTINUED…

As I think about it more and more I am even more convinced that the universe grew out of uncertainty. Uncertainty as it is unstable because of itself and a universe and our existence are merely conformed uncertainties. Now, how do the sort of certainty we see come from? The answer is certainty itself. Suppose that the universe came into existence, now there are some directly linked uncertainties \(that is their contradiction would lead to the previous uncertainty contradicting and hence lead to a parallel universe and so on\) like the type of universe and one would get confirmed and evolve as our universe. But the confirmations cannot contradict inevitable stuff like our formation and that in the "end" principle is always uncertainty. Thus like the density of prime numbers the uncertainty is always reducing. 
HOW TO MAKE SENSE OF THE THEORY
Firstly you cannot contradict this principle\-I can easily openly challenge anyone that you cannot. A universe can evolve through this principle and at least our universe is one of them.

The fact that it is hard to work on it is that I realized that we are full of prejudices.  And the reason why I may accept a possible solution is only because of prejudice. Our particular structure is in no way comparable to the beginning of the universe. We may make up a universe but it can only be possible based on extensive trial and error and to replicate the uncertainty at the very beginning would amount to immense number of samples \(if I needed to find 1000 prime numbers it’s much easier to start from 1 than a million\). This means only one that either the solution will come in years, decades, even centuries perhaps or if we are lucky or good enough we may get it in a year too.

But there is a catch\-we do not need to play god\(you don’t use QM to predict the flight of an airplane\). By simply analysing and interpreting what the theory can tell us would probably give surprising or extremely path breaking results. And since this theory is undeniably true, there’s no risk involved\- either you get it or you don’t.

I urge you all to try for all different sorts of interpretations\- although I somehow could manage the fundamentals; I alone am too biased for the rest of it.  
## ON THE BEAUTY OF IT

Now, going back, nothing can be made "perfect" because there is only one of it "uncertainty" and the rest are dependent on it. Now laws are simply observations used to make our work easier.

Einstein said that god doesn't play dice with the world, in fact if there was a god he was perfectly \(you know what I mean, right?\) correct, only we were too idiotic to realize his genius. But the thing is that god cannot be the reason, it turns out that the dice plays the world.

So, would the theory be contradicted if we discovered GOD\-no, if we could discover him then we could describe him and thus explain him as a part of the theory\-But then he would cease to remain a GOD and hence we can safely say that a GOD cannot exist.

At the very least this theory provides immense intellectual satisfaction, we can actually say that we know the reason for everything without really needing to know everything \(refer my first article\).

So we can finally carry on with our work\!\!\! 
## APPLICATIONS

Since the theory can describe anything imaginable it can account for in fact all our most basic of principles hitherto not understood like the conservation of energy and so on. To have a basic understanding of such fundamental principles means a great deal, we may actually learn immensely about them and the places where they are applicable and to what extent.

Like always knowledge is power and for the first time we may be able to see law making in action rather than just studying them from a distance.
However the potential is basically untapped and only one with immense patience may get it. Basically sooner or later when we would have exhausted all your irrational methods, we would come back to this principle for guidance.

Believe me or not, THIS IS THE FUTURE. 
## SIMPLIFYING THUS,

“UNCERTAINTY IS THE CAUSE FOR EVERYTHING”

Now, this information is enough to explain everything, but since it is so hard to understand I help you like this\-

HOW UNCERTAINTY “EVOLVES”

Uncertainty by itself is unstable because of itself, it brings about a myriad range of possibilities. Now the uncertainties have certain strange properties. An amazing possibility is of the evolution of a universe. Exactly how is difficult to explain though, but briefly speaking uncertainty can evolve based upon certain possibilities which imply the existence of the previous possibilities. Now certainties evolves when the uncertainties cannot contradict the certainties which led to it.

Simply speaking\-out of the many different possibilities our universe is one.  
## ON FURTHER DEVELOPMENT

Anything we build on the theory will not be perfect and it is not a practical idea to build from "scratch"; but what can be done is to work as hard as possible and see patterns emerge. Let us not forget that it has never been done before after all. But firstly an urgent need is to develop more tools to work on the theory something for which an intense intuition about the whole process is a compulsion. Nevertheless, whatever the methods, you can only add to the theory, I do not know how you can subtract.
## INSIGHTS

This is basically to validate the idea of evolution of certainty from uncertainty and a deeper understanding of the process.
So, why does uncertainty not cause immediate breakdown of our laws\-

This is basically a question related to a misinterpretation of the theory.

It can but only after the formation of our laws which means that uncertainty leads to parallel universes in which our laws are not contradicted.
Once certainty has happened it cannot “un”happen. It can get cancelled in some universes but there always will be some in which it remains intact.

The basic fault for the misconception perhaps lies with the time factor. The evolution of uncertainty has not got much to do with time except that it is a by\-product of it like matter is. Uncertainty just got the notion of previous events and order \(the 1, 2, 3... one\).What this means is that EVERYTHING CAN HAPPEN AT ONCE \(and uncertainty can end\) because the certainties evolved would anyways cannot “un”happen.

Uncertainty can have a start and end for a particular universe\-but that may not apply for the universe itself.

Probably we can experience uncertainty at the earliest stages\- there are always parallel universes leading to it \(and everything else\).

SO UNCERTAINTY IS ALWAYS THERE – WE ARE JUST STRUCK TO OUR UNIVERSE\-\(maybe because of our structure\).
## WHY I WOULD CALL IT THE T.O.E.

Many people do not realize that a theory of everything will not be complete if we just give equations to explain outcomes in the physical world \(as far as we know, we anyways cannot\) it must also explain "why" the world is as it is.

The uncertainty theory accomplishes this task precisely. It provides a basis for our understanding of all phenomenon, just what a T.O.E. is supposed to do.

Basically I would like to mention that calling it a T.O.E. would imply that the theory "is" nature and I am limited by my human ability to make it clear. Put it simply, all I have written is just to make the matter clearer and the different concepts such as evolution I used ARE NOT THE T.O.E.

As of now it is perfectly consistent with all we know and satisfies all the requirements to be called a true “THEORY OF EVERYTHING”.

# ‘The Theory of Uncertainty’\- A METAPHYSICAL THEORY OF EVERYTHING
## ABSTRACT

Ever heard people say that “If there is no God then what is the true reason for everything”? The current physics aim to find a unifying theory can find the required equations to explain everything but cannot say anything about how they came to be in the first place. Here is an attempt at a theory which could give an explanation of all that could be there, the answer to our questions.

‘The Theory of Uncertainty’ is a theory which is based on the simple principle, that “Uncertainty Causes Everything” which explains the logic behind everything \(including our universe\). In the most basic sense, it encompasses the ideas of uncertainty, evolution and causality.

Since this theory is consistent with everything, it should be theoretically possible to construct all the guiding principles and equations eventually building further on it.

One of the principles of this theory is that only the statement “Uncertainty Causes Everything” is perfect and anything build on it would be a fundamental law only for a particular subset or a universe.

It can, however, be a framework for the “understanding” of all phenomenon. Surely how we understand the deepest levels of uncertainty would be crucial here.
 
## THE SEARCH FOR THE ULTIMATE TRUTH AND UNCERTAINTY


It is natural to wonder and think on many aspects, viewpoints and opinions on the world that bother us and sometimes such relentless thinking can get frustratingly pointless given it has been pursued by almost everyone existed and from different angles and still there seems to be absolutely nothing that can be said for certain about this world in general considering the bigger picture of existence.

Also, it can often be noticed that we are all great at connecting stuff and forming fragile yet quick connections about everything and this often yields an often obvious but flawed sense of correctness.

The point is that, is it possible that what we have discovered till now is untrue and in fact just a statistical complexity of the bigger picture?

But with more and more experience the chances of this happening is steadily diminishing \(and this seems to be the reason for our excitement every time everything seems to fit in\).

Although we have laws which “seem” never to be violated but at the same time have no reason not to. However good our efforts seem to be; though practical \(at least in our experiments\) our knowledge seems not to take us in one direction towards the ultimate truth, but in multiple directions.

When Sir Isaac Newton found mechanics the world thought we were close enough to the ultimate knowledge but were wrong when we looked at things from a different perspective\-big\-relativity and small\-quantum. The thing is, our solutions work specifically\-for us, for quantum or for relativity, they do not work together.

So what is to be done? The practical or the broad minded? The answer lies in one aspect we have been missing all along \- ‘Uncertainty’. And this must have long been inculcated from nature. Nature would never know what lies ahead and what suits best to the present environment may fare pathetically to the coming climate. It is wise to be just practical and learn the best from now?

Suppose a brand of super humans were developing in one part of the world and suddenly a tsunami wiped them off but a group of humans ordinary though survived. Was nature fair? Well stupid in our narrow mindedness but fair.

Although it may not be perfect, the presence of the ‘LUCK” factor makes it far superior to other models.

What this also means is that everything can happen at once \(and uncertainty can end\) because the certainties evolved would anyways cannot ‘un’happen.

Uncertainty can have a start and end for a particular universe\-but that universe may go on.
