As Hitler said

The most effective and popular propaganda is not lies, but showing only one side of the argument excessively. If you look around, it's natural, present everywhere, and effective.

Democracy requires everyone to be aware of all the issues affecting the country in addition to our personal affairs for questionable benefit. As everyone cannot do the research from scratch, they resort to the media. Propaganda can easily sway the whole country.

This shows how stupid Democracy is and being in stable rules is so much more peaceful if there is tolerance. We keep watching all the propaganda news and being informed all the time while doing a bad job at it like sheeps.
It's better to just focus on our work and making the life of the people around us good.

When there is a stable rules based government then ordinary people can relax and not indulge in politics. There is no need for crowdsourcing decisions, while it can be done occasionally via protests.

Even in a non democracy there are police and courts for personal issues. It seems democracy is only good for large scale issues and direct participation in law making. This is not required if we have stable rules and policy. Many countries have done this successfully.

It is also true that due to hedonism and short term thinking, many of us do not know what is best for us.
