The most effective and popular propaganda is not lies, but showing only one side of the argument excessively. If you look around, it's natural, present everywhere, and effective.

Democracy requires everyone to be aware of all the issues affecting the country in addition to our personal affairs for questionable benefit. As everyone cannot do the research from scratch, they resort to the media. Propaganda can easily sway the whole country.

This shows how stupid Democracy is and being in stable rules is so much more peaceful if there is tolerance. We keep watching all the propaganda news and being informed all the time while doing a bad job at it like sheeps.
It's better to just focus on our work and making the life of the people around us good.

When there is a stable rules based government then ordinary people can relax and not indulge in politics. There is no need for crowdsourcing decisions, while it can be done occasionally via protests.

Even in a non democracy there are police and courts for personal issues. It seems democracy is only good for large scale issues and direct participation in law making. This is not required if we have stable rules and policy. Many countries have done this successfully.

It is also true that due to hedonism and short term thinking, many of us do not know what is best for us.

One solution in favor of democracy is just don't watch the news and media and don't participate in voting. But this can end up very negative if done in groups when other groups vote heavily. Wrong decisions in a democracy often face less criticism and have an aura of authenticity but it is not justified as seen in the violence against Rohingya muslims in Myanmar after Myanmar became a democracy leading it to become a military dictatorship again.



Update: 

Q) Democracy is not stupid: Democracy is a system of government that allows people to have a say in the decisions that affect their lives. Democracy promotes human rights, freedom, equality, justice, and accountability. Democracy is not perfect, but it is better than dictatorship, where people have no voice or choice.

A) Really? Do I really have a say in the decisions that affect my life? It is very easy for democracy to become a tyranny of the majority. What do I do then with my one vote? If I resist and campaign a lot I can be put in jail under various laws preventing dissent in democracies. Also, it is a lie that in a dictatorship people have no voice or choice as mentioned above. Just like a democracy there is executive and Judiciary, also people can talk to the leaders to solve their issues. If nothing else, like democracies, there is the option to protest.

My point is not to give the western idea of democracies a free reign and criticize other governments unfairly rather than objectively.
