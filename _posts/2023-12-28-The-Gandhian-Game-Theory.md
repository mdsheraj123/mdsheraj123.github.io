I recently watched a YouTube video of one of the best science YouTubers <a href="https://youtu.be/mScpHTIi-kM?si=Zt9PJjEGc7SzkjNS" target="_blank">What The Prisoner's Dilemma Reveals About Life, The Universe, and Everything - Veritasium</a>.

If we study Mahatma Gandhi’s game theory strategy in the context of this video we see that what Mahatma Gandhi did was something beyond human logic. 
No wonder Albert Einstein had the following to say about him.

“Generations to come will scarce believe that such a one as this ever in flesh and blood walked upon this earth.”
― Albert Einstein

He not only freed India from British colonial rule but ended colonialism the world over. Even in countries that could not technically end colonialism by themselves using pure military strength unlike India.
Mahatma Gandhi is a global citizen.

It seems to me that Mahatma Gandhi instinctively knew the very long term game theory games. He took advantage of the fact that the nice strategies which do not retaliate unprovoked are the winning strategies by using it against the winners themselves. He ruined the long term game of the winners, destroying them in the process.

The brutal Britishers were in a stalemate against Gandhi due to their own assumed moral superiority.
I do not know how effective it was, but the fact that it worked somehow is magical and what matters ultimately.

Veritasium says at the end, be nice, forgiving, and don’t be a pushover.
Well in the real world, there are other strategies I have observed as rare but non extinct.

Actually, the world is much more complicated than this game but it is interesting and something we can learn from to try and understand the world better.
