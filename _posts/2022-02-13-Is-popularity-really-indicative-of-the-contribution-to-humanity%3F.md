It's actually simple, can most people recognize what really matters to them?

If popularity was everything, celebrities would have contributed more to society than scientists.

Actually people admire revolutionaries, Steve Jobs revolutionized the mobile phone and Newton, Einstein revolutionized Physics. People like to have that feeling of importance and rise above the system. We inherently don't want to be a cog in the machine, we have higher needs in the maslow\-pyramid. The worst nightmare at the highest level is to die as to never have existed and on the other side is being immortal in the future in the minds of people.

People also admire those they want to be. For example, people admire IAS officers in India as they want to be them \(which is for a variety of reasons\). This is also why some people admire influential gangsters like Dawood Ibrahim. 

Dennis Ritchie may have made a lot of contributions but the reason for his lack of popularity is that most people don't want to be like him. They can't relate to him and his intellectual leaning. This on the other hand works in the favor of Steve Jobs. 

Most people wanted Steve Jobs' lifestyle and doing what he was doing \(taking ideas from others and choosing from them\) rather than with Dennis Ritchie working on insanely hard problems and living an average life.

Coming to the relatable part. Ofcourse the job of Steve Jobs may be tough in the sense that it was riskier with more money was riding on his decisions but the job itself was certainly doable if you were lucky. Compare this with doing the work of Dennis Ritchie where no luck would help you if you were a common man.
*Detour: All of these people working in high risk bet a lot on luck and I think is not a good thing. Your risk\*reward should be much greater than the mean compensation you can get with very less risk otherwise you did nothing great and were just lucky. You can work harder and do proper research to make your risk less and make the rewards more to achieve this. *

People admiring those they want to be encourages the behaviour we want to see ourselves doing. Also, this takes us towards behaviours that benefit the most people. But this does not directly encourage contribution to humanity, just our own selfish interests.

The long term interest of humanity is to incentivize contribution to humanity. We need to celebrate the real contributors to society when we can recognize them.

I think our society has indeed recognized this need and if not with fame, we atleast honor the people who bring real contributions with monetary benefit.

There are protections like patents for inventions and copyright for software that you build assuming you are not already compensated by the organisation you are working under.
*Detour: I think working under an organization means you should reach an agreement for a percentage share of all profits generated from your work. This may be tough to do in practice for each employee and hence granting shares of the company seems a good option.*

Ofcourse you can make your invention freely available to increase reach by denying a patent or making your work open source but that's on you.

I think with monetary benefit and status, fame is not needed. We cannot force the average person to be what they cannot be.

But still, there are many researchers out there who barely get compensated directly for the immense work they do for our future. Things like theoretical physics bring benefits in the long term and are not immediately be of any economic value. Governments need to step in to compensate these people fairly. The caveat is that not being linked to any tangible benefit runs the risk of investing in possibly dead ends like String Theory.
