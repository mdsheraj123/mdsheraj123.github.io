As per 'Systems Thinking', our efforts lead to side effects that affect our end outcome along with effects that might be independent of us that affect our end outcome.
We might be able to control both to some extent.

My question is how to judge our work, should it be based solely on our efforts, or solely based on the end outcomes?

Judging on efforts might be easy on us but we might not go the extra mile along with wasting time on busy work, while judging on outcome might be uncertain and harsh.

I am extremely convinced from my experience that we should judge ourselves and others based solely on the outcomes. That is the only rational way to make progress.

I have never judged myself and others by my efforts for a long time and have been largely successful. However this surely came at a huge expense of stress for me and others but the results were worth it.

Ofcourse just a little bit of rewards for efforts might be necessary for survival and positivity but it should never overpower the basic principle of outcomes.

It might work out in the short term to judge by actions in fields where chance plays a huge role, such as cricket. However this falls apart in the long run as people figure it out and rewarding effort is very subjective requiring a lot of bureaucracy.

When you focus on the outcomes, you reward real progress and for the actions taken beyond what can be measured.

_You moved from a poor/conflict ridden country to one which provided better education? Good! You will do better on the IIT Advanced, but in the admissions process of Harvard you will not have a good story of your struggles in adversity and can be rejected despite your better grades compared to the yourself who stayed back._

Knowing that only the outcomes will be considered makes us extra diligent and careful to consider all\-around factors, however, it can lead to much anxiety. An example of outcome\-based evaluation is objective systems such as the IIT Advanced exam of India while an example of an intention\-based evaluation is subjective systems such as the admissions process of US Universities like Harvard and MIT.


**Update:**

Religion says God judges by the intentions of our actions and not the results.
But I am not god and I cannot know your intentions long term or short term. Hence the only way I can objectively evaluate is by the end results.

It is best to not pretend to be God and think that we have considered all the parameters. I am convinced beyond doubt that evaluating objectively by the end results is the only way to be efficient.

This is ruthless but fair. Although we can relax the ignoring of efforts a bit to make it practical for everyone. Some countries with more free markets are results oriented to a greater extent and are often richer.
