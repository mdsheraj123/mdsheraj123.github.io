# The longest\-running study on happiness

Link is [https://www.adultdevelopmentstudy.org/](https://www.adultdevelopmentstudy.org/).
**Methodology**: A study that has tracked the lives of 724 men for 78 years, and one of the longest studies of adult life ever done. Investigators surveyed the group every two years about their physical and mental health, their professional lives, their friendships, their marriages — and also subjected them to periodic in\-person interviews, medical exams, blood tests and brain scans.

This Harvard Study has a popular TED talk [https://www.ted.com/talks/robert\_waldinger\_what\_makes\_a\_good\_life\_lessons\_from\_the\_longest\_study\_on\_happiness](https://www.ted.com/talks/robert_waldinger_what_makes_a_good_life_lessons_from_the_longest_study_on_happiness) in which the researcher Robert Waldinger says the study does not have much in absolute conclusions but one thing stands out:
"Good relationships keep us happier and healthier, and loneliness kills."

Other conclusions as per [https://ideas.ted.com/4\-lessons\-from\-the\-longest\-running\-study\-on\-happiness/](https://ideas.ted.com/4-lessons-from-the-longest-running-study-on-happiness/):

1. A happy childhood has very, very long\-lasting effects.

2. But … people with difficult childhoods can make up for them in midlife.

3. Learning how to cope well with stress has a lifelong payoff.

4. Time with others protects us from the bruises of life’s ups and downs.
# Ability To Delay Gratification One Of The Most Powerful Predictors Of Success

**Methodology**:The researchers collected the data from over 2500 participants who took an online test. To measure the ability to delay gratification, the participants were asked whether they would take $500 dollars immediately or take $1000 dollars at one of five different levels of delay. The periods of delay were a day, a week, a month, half a year or an entire year.

As per [https://sciencetrends.com/study\-suggests\-ability\-to\-delay\-gratification\-one\-of\-the\-most\-powerful\-predictors\-of\-success/](https://sciencetrends.com/study-suggests-ability-to-delay-gratification-one-of-the-most-powerful-predictors-of-success/) researchers found utilizing machine learning algorithms that:
"delay discounting is more predictive of income than age, ethnicity, or height."

This supports the conclusions of the infamous Marshmallow Test.

**Methodology**: The Marshmallow Test was a test run at Stanford University in the 60s, which aimed to measure children’s ability to delay gratification. The researchers left children alone in an empty room with a marshmallow, telling them that they could eat the marshmallow now or wait for a number of minutes and have two marshmallows. The researchers tracked the 90 or so children who participated in the study over the next couple decades and during the follow\-up, they found that the children who were able to resist the marshmallow long enough to get a second one were substantially more likely to have lower BMIs, higher SAT scores, and generally be more successful.
