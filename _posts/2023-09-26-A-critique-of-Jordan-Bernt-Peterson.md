Jordan Peterson \(JBP\) has repeatedly said in his lectures, "and I think that is the right idea, the idea of individual responsibility, and the west is based upon that idea too".

It is funny because it is not a coincidence that what he thinks is the right idea is the idea of the west. It's what he grew up with, it's what is his firsthand experience and comfort. He sometimes sells this idea as the ultimate truth. He says that he is convinced that the western ideals are correct and obvious and the only possible solution. JBP is at best the representation of the western world.

Jordan Peterson has firsthand experience of only the western way of life.

Jordan Peterson has said one of his aims would be to be the person to turn up to in the face of a global catastrophe. I would say he alone is not qualified for that, probably he can be chosen as one among equals with JBP representing the west.

The New York Times called JBP the most influential intellectual in the western world right now. The key work being western world because that's what he represents.

I want to know how JBP reconciles with the fact that no matter how much he studies about different cultures like the east, he would never have them as the primary foundation of his thinking or perception of existence. There would be things he would be just blind to in his evaluation.

For example, the stark difference in family values and marriage \(dating culture\). He keeps on promoting the western way, just because it worked okay for him personally \(I can't say that for his family even\).

JBP gives examples only of thinkers from the west like Nietzsche. What about thinkers from the Africa, Middle East, India, China, or Japan?

JBP only ever goes on tour to Christian countries like the US, Europe, or Australia.

This is just to show that JBP is not all knowing, because he sometimes gets arrogant, and is only human with just one lifetime to try his best. He would definitely go down as one of the greats, but not 'the' great.

Although I personally have learned a lot from him, JBP represents the west only, just getting this straight before we give him more credit than is due.

My advice to JBP: Learn more about the east, because he is weak in that area, has a lot to catch up, and the east is rising while he has firsthand experience of the west only.

My solution: To generate policy, being honest, objective, and defining rules transparently only based on competence for the task is the solution. Also, this is the conclusion of JBP \(if we don't have rules, all we will have are rules\).
**Addendum:**

1. JBP misses the bigger picture. And always. JBP is not the savior of the downtrodden as he claims to be. He is just an interpreter from the west whose interpretation helps people in the west. Do you really not see why JBP is not popular in Africa, India, China, or Japan.

2. I do not go by exceptions but probabilities to make judgement. What are the percentage of people in these regions, who have consumed his work, and it helped them?

3. His interviews, I have observed him interrupting his guests a lot \(especially when he has a guest who has a subject he is not familiar with\), it concerns me. You will notice the comments pointing it out too. He is just getting too old maybe. He interrupts in the spirit of wanting to make sure both of them are having the same kind of language and definitions, which is okay. But it happens too much. He has got old. It is sad. It was a good ride. I hope he becomes humble. Old people are most lovely when humble.

4. He helped me put my life together. Probably I am asking too much from him. I am grateful, but this had to be said since he is going down the arrogance path and I want him to be humble.

5. I am not faulting JBP, just saying that he is not God, only human, and that he should be humble. JBP routinely misses the writing on the wall, and even after his reluctant efforts to learn other cultures, he is just not able to see things from the eastern perspective. The part of him being a representative of the west is an obvious one but it seems everyone overlooks. I am just saying this explicitly. JBP says that nobody ever gets away with anything, even once. This is true for him too. His persistent downplaying of the eastern way of life, and refusal to see things from the eastern perspective has led to problems in his life. He says "I just for the life of me cannot see what I did wrong".
