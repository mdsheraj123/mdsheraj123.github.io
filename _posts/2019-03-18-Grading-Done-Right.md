Recently I came across this post on ‘Dardanaak Bitsians’, the BITS specific meme site –

{% include image.html url="/assets/img/posts/0+%284%29.png" caption="" alt="" %}

The first thing that came to my mind on looking at this post was, this is, actually just a \*\*\*\* \*\*\*, try better next time for just about every BITSIAN who happens to be fortunate enough to be there \(where *everyone* seems to be better than you in just about anything you do, literally\). But then,

Firstly, I think anything more than an A should never be given.

Perfect 100%, the highest possible mark is not just 5 or even 10 percent better than, let’s say, a 95%; it is infinitely better. Because, if I go to a kindergarten and get a hundred percent in writing alphabets or words, it doesn’t mean I am 5% better than the guy scoring ninety\-five; I can be infinitely better\!

It’s just that it’s the maximum possible grade and no institute, no exam is worthy of giving a perfect score in the understanding of a subject at any difficulty, it just means that the person wasn’t tested well enough.

If you believe me and want the grading system to be in lines with this, then the answer is already there, something which is so unfathomably put aside in this politically correct world that most people ignore it even with solid evidence pointing towards it every single time\!

If you try to fit the simplest function you can think of in lines with my definition of capability, then Capability = \(marks got\)^a would be ideal. Here the max mark is taken as infinity.

We take the inverse of x^a, plotting 1/x^a this time.

This would be ‘Ease of getting x’. This also turns out to be the cumulative distribution of the students with at least x marks. This is because a person who has ease of getting x marks already has ease of getting x\-n marks.

Differentiating it and plotting absolute value, we get

Population distribution of students with a particular fraction of marks i.e. x. This curve is characteristic of Pareto Population Distribution.

If we derivate F\_bar\(x\) to get the population at every income x, then we get the plot to be

Population density\(x\) = \\[\-\frac\{a\*x\_\{m\}^\{a\}\}\{x^\{a\+1\}\}\\]

Which is similar to Figure 4. Income is ‘marks got’ here.

But actually, this is not the complete reality with the plot explaining the tail part of the distribution well and in reality, the plot looks something like this –

Something I believe is either artificial or because of constant removal.
# How to make a paper so that grade comes as per Capability?

What if we have 10% questions at 10% difficulty, 10% at 20% difficulty, 10% at 30% difficulty and so on till 10% at 100%\(ideally\) difficulty. With the questions being such that anyone knowing the answer to a question with let’s say 70% difficulty being sure to know the answers to all questions with lesser difficulty.

This way the ‘Ease of getting x marks’ will be cumulative, something exactly we desired.

What we mean by 20% difficult would depend on what α capability curve is desired.

A close example here being the six problems in increasing difficulty at the Putnam. Although in Putnam, the higher difficulty problems are sometimes solved and lower ones not.
# Finally, how to grade?

Well, if you follow everything, the marks are your grade\!

They exactly reflect your capability\!

BTW\- If you’re still unsure, ask any prof, at least at BITS and they will let you know how normal and how Pareto the final marks distribution looks like\!
# ADDENDUM: The Relation between Pareto and Gaussian distributions

For Pareto Distributions\-

1\) Population distribution = α/\(\(marks got\)^\(α\+1\)\)

2\) Ease of lost x fraction of marks i.e. Cumulative Population Distribution = 1/\(marks got\)^α

3\) Capability = \(marks got\)^α

What if we want a gaussian distribution of students’ marks?

This is the curves for if the knowledge was tested in a Pareto and a Gaussian exam paper pattern.

Looking at the Capability as per grade graph, we can tell that if we are tested on a Pareto scale, we can more accurately determine very high capabilities.

Pareto grading is all thanks to the way the question paper is set with a person knowing question no x knowing answers to all x\-n questions.

If no such rule existed with each question independent of each other, the population distribution of the marks will be Gaussian.

Pareto is dependent questions, Gaussian is independent questions. The question is which set of questions is better, Pareto or Gaussian distribution?

Pareto \-> Tests extremes well, Expertise, connections, preciseness, but harsher

Gaussian \-> Tests mean well, Random knowledge, unreliable, but student\-friendly
# Conclusions


Pareto is when the wealthy has all that the poor guy has and more. Something which holds for money.

If we find the distribution for something which is a sum of varied unrelated things, the distribution will be more Gaussian. E.g. the number of stocks with a particular gain from various stock markets.

Pareto means the above entity is better in all respects, Gaussian is aggregate.
