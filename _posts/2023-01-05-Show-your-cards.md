I really love the Chinese strategy 
"Hide your strength, bide your time."

It is credited as the reason behind the silent Chinese domination of global manufacturing via exports.

But I don't like playing games. I believe in showing all my cards upfront.
Obviously except the most critical thing that we cannot live without. The hiding of the most critical thing is to account for randomness and evil which is ultimately incompetance explained in one of my other blog posts.

This prevents a lot of lose lose stalemates. Sometimes it is best to just get things done with outright.

By showing our vulnerabilities, we make the enemy get out of their safe spot and be vulnerable to show their weaknesses too.

The logic behind this is not necessarily to win from superiority, actually it aims for shared victory the benefits of which would be be higher than even a hostile victory for both the parties.


If anyone has dealt with a narcissist, then it is very defeating.
By the way I don't belive in narcissistic people, only people acting narcissistic due to their circumstances.
Negotiating with a narcissist is impossible especially from a position of weakness, if we say we want x, they think okay he wants x so I will destroy x or use the threat of destroying x as a bargaining chip to further oppress him.

I have personally experienced this and believe this to be how the Palestianians feel when they have to negotiate with the occupiers. They say it feels like dealing with a narcissist.

In dealing with a narcissist, after getting burned a few times, people start hiding things. The narcissist on the other hand sees the hiding of things by the other side as dishonesty and gets even more mad.

Eventually both sides end up in a very stressful stalemate where we cannot say anything as saying anything makes things worse.

Point to be noted is even the narcissist might be actually scared and just holding out to one small bargaining advantage to improve something really important. They do not want to give up the bargaining chip and it is exactly what we want.

From either side, the other might be a narcissist.

How to break out of this stalemate?

I have discovered the answer is to expose our whole position all at once which would baffle the other side. This would also gain the other side's trust as we just exposed several of our vulnerabilities. This would empower the other side to expose their vulnerabilities too because if they were attacked, they could attack us too using all our vulnerabilities.

Now something magical happens when both sides are vulnerable. We see the other side's pain and point of view. It helps to actually solve the problem instead of always fighting for narrow gains.

The focus here is on the solution, the reality, the truth, to do the right thing.
The right thing to do is the best thing to do. With limited knowledge, it is not always clear always that it is the case but with more knowlege the ultimate truth comes, which is faith. 

Faith is that the world is inherently good which means what is the the truth is the best version of reality. Hence this world is a journey to seek the truth, for our best lives. Fighting each other hides the truth from all of us in our limited view.

So the best strategy is show your cards. (Just don't do gambling, leave the game, it's not good for us. Honesy is the best policy, the complications arise only from our own imperfections.)
