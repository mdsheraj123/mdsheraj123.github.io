The zionist not only pour their deep pockets into propaganda, but the reason it is so effective is that they make money off it. This is why they own all the media, and not just spend money on the media.

Probably Zionist is not the right term, it is the colonial superiority mindset that justifies oppression and apartheid.

This is why the boycott of the oppressor's products is so effective.

Anyways the local products are almost always cheaper and often healthier and fresher alternatives with less chemicals.
