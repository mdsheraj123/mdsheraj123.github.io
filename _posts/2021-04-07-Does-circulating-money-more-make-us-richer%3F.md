We all know per capita income is GDP/population. And GDP is just the total amount of goods and services produced in a country. Another way to calculate it would be to consider the total income of all people.

Consider this.

A grows $100 rice and B grows $100 wheat per year. They could just eat it and GDP increased by $200.

However, now A trades $100 worth of rice for $100 worth of wheat from B.

But notice that then the total income of A is $200; $100 from the field and $100 from the wheat farmer. Similarly for farmer B.

This gives the total GDP to be $400, up from $200 when there was no trade.

Seems like nonsense. Just by money exchanging hands, everyone is richer. Consider another example.

You live your day to day life, but then you conduct an experiment.

You pay $10 for an apple to a farmer. The farmer spends the extra $10 to enlist your brother to make a website for him. Your brother was hungry while making the website so he paid his $10 to you get the apple.

Nothing happened from your point of view but now you are everyone is $10 richer \(they earned an extra $10\), including you. And that will show up in the GDP.

Note that normally, it is much more complicated than this. Normally you would buy an apple from a grocer and the grocer would buy from the food company making the food company richer spending more on a website that employs your software engineer brother making him a little bit richer and he gives you a more expensive gift.

The cycle is there but it is spread out. Ideally, everyone would be richer from your decision to buy the apple but it is very spread out. In fact, you would be benefitting from someone's decision to buy a new iPhone via the power of distributing money.

So, that means if we just spend more money, we would all be richer and that money would anyways come back to us \(not necessarily uniformly\). Basically, money would have circulated, GDP would have increased, along with its per capita income.
## What does it imply?


Money changing hands makes everyone richer and boosts the economy but suppose you force it, theoretically everyone will be richer, but will that money bring you joy?

Money is a measurement of value but what really matters is what value you bring to others and yourself and not the money you earn. It just happens so that we have decided to quantify that value by money, which is what others are willing to pay for your value add.

If you hack the system to make everyone earn more money, everyone will have more money but the same value.

Another hack is if the government charges more tax, but at the same time gives more subsidy to everyone for net\-zero money retention. The government would increase its income and the country's GDP but it would not improve people's life.

The government does improve people's lives, but it does so by adding value like rule of law and security.

People's lives improve by value added by circulation. 

People circulate money because it adds value. They could get malicious and everyone just exchanges $100 with everyone but that would just reduce the value of money even though they have earned more money.

So do not think of how much money you earn but how much value you add to people's and your own lives because that's what truly matters.

## Planned obsolescence


Planned obsolescence makes you richer but does not make your life better. 

People making bridges just to break them gives them more money but does not make their life better.

War can increase the industrial output but it does not make the lives of people any better than the no\-war situation.
