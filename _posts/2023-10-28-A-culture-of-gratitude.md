I respect the countries of the gulf a lot. It is impressive how they have managed their countries.

I doubt the figures on the proven oil reserves, but still the Gulf countries are neither the largest producers of oil, nor have the largest oil reserves.

The Gulf countries are not so rich as everyone thinks. They just save money well because of their gratitude to God. 

Look at Venezuela with more oil than all of the gulf states, they lost it all due to corruption. The USA has more oil than probably all countries, but you would never hear it say that it is rich in resources, they keep it hidden.


Every country says they don't have enough resources, no country ever says they have a lot of resources. Look at the fertile mineral rich lands of the USA and India with everything one could ask for, sustaining huge populations with ease.  But everyone knows that a literal desert has lots of resources. It is just gratitude and thanking God for what God has given.

The religious centric establishment with God as the supreme ruler and everyone as God's servants including the rulers means that no entity has supreme authority over God. This I believe has helped the Gulf countries preserve their resources and not fall in the trap of corruption that Venezuela found itself in ruining the life of its citizens.

The Gulf states are humble and realize that the oil is finite and that they have to rise which leads us to their effort of modernization.
