Doing other people's work for them \(for example in office\), including thinking ahead of the conversation in advance before reacting, is the best way to make people happy.



It might seem to be the strangest of things but practicing the 2000\-10s style pickup artist techniques taught me how to converse with any stranger.

Practicing pickup on women is a very high risk strategy and barely possible today in my opinion but it taught me a lot.

It turns out men and women are pretty much the same and men would act the same if we could interchange the bodies. No wonder out of the 46 chromosomes only one chromosome is different in men and women. It is the dynamics of life given to women that would mean they act that way.

Here's what I learned \- pickup talk works and it works great to have conversations with strangers \(I never felt comfortable in my conscience to go further than talk so that's all I know\).

The interesting part is the pickup artist style works better on men than women. I could understand that nobody tried that much effort to talk to men, most men are lonely who might have received probably a single compliment in a long time or probably their lifetime from a stranger.

But what really is the pickup strategy? It's basically playing a game where we ridicule, insult, or casually be honest about what we feel while at the same time balancing it with compliments. It also involves being mysterious and caring less about the other as if we were higher status and worth more. A lot of deception and creating an image that is not true is also involved but I left that out since my conscience won't let me lie.

So basically, I would be completely honest and start with a mean comment \(that is true and might help them have perspective\), while being totally open and non combative to facilitate an honest conversation and build trust, vulnerability to showcase ourselves as an honest person. This is opposed to being completely nice which is in fact manipulative and brings suspicion in the other person as to what our true motives are and will not let them open up and build a trusting connection.

People usually reveal things about themselves less because they feel vulnerable. If we start with revealing things about us, they might feel that I am myself vulnerable now and that with the knowledge he can harm me if I harm him, so he starts revealing things about him. This is a mutual vulnerability that builds trust. It is not a bad thing because we all want to discuss about ourselves to see if we are right but do not want to get vulnerable and hurt in the process.

A lot of people hide things and get scammed \(for example in ponzi schemes\) because they think if they share the information they might lose the golden chance at a huge reward which nobody else knows about. Well, there is no free lunch and usually people realize the truth when they ask a few people who they can trust with their vulnerability. It is a give and take.

I have learned that the best people do not run after us, the people that run after us get a lot from us that they cannot get from others easily \(basically to scam\). The best people do their job honestly and in good faith mostly because they have nothing to gain from us. This means the good people will not run after us too much.

I help others, itâ€™s a give and take rather than being manipulative. It is best to go slow and learn from experience the best balance.

Also the best way to make friends in a new place or with strangers is to talk to the quiet ones. Talking to the popular ones will only reduce my confidence and it's generally not worth it given the power struggle. We just want to make friends and be happy.
