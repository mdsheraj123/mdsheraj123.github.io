Exploring the world as a science and tech guy. First impressions aren't always right and conflicting viewpoints make it tough to decide what is right. Thinking concepts again at leisure, trying rationally this time.

The aim of my content is to give new ideas to think about that someone may not have realized. There is no intention to convince anyone of anything. It is not hard to realize this from my content which does not have an introduction or conclusion. I do not claim to understand everything and I am still exploring to reach the truth. I have realized many times that I have been completely wrong in the past many times and that too confidently.

_Note: I run all my blog posts through spelling and Grammar check and AI for proofreading before publishing. Hence you can expect a basic level of quality in the blog posts._

_Disclaimer: Views are personal and do not represent any entity other than my private life. What I have written is what I feel, and although I have tried my best to remove incorrect statements, it is possible that some information is incorrect._
